    "explanation": "A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan or city area. This is the most appropriate choice based on the requirements provided. MAN is a term applied to the interconnection of local area networks (LANs) or campus area networks (CANs) across a city into a single larger network. A MAN is larger than a CAN or LAN but smaller than a WAN. A local area network (LAN) is a network where all the nodes or hosts participating in the network are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless media. A wide area network (WAN) is a network that spans multiple geographic locations such as the internet. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits. A personal area network (PAN) is a close-range network that is usually based on Bluetooth or NFC for communications between personal devices, such as smartphones, laptops, printers, and other peripheral devices."

Measured service is a term that IT professionals apply to cloud computing that references services where the cloud provider measures or monitors the provision of services for various reasons, including billing, effective use of resources, or overall predictive planning. Using a synchronization app can allow the files to be stored on both the laptop and the cloud service while maintaining the latest versions in both places. This allows a user to synchronize content between all of their own devices and share their cloud storage content with other users. Multiple users can simultaneously access the content to work collaboratively, or they can access it at different times. Each user's changes are typically marked with a flag or color highlighting to indicate who made changes to what content. Virtual application streaming allows an application to be delivered to a workstation from the cloud."

To do this, they need to choose the right technology for their displays. Which technology should Dion Consulting recommend to allow for the thinnest laptop displays?",
    "options": [
      "LCD",
      "LED",
      "IPS",
      "OLED"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "OLED",
    "explanation": "An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits visible light. Thus, it can display deep black levels and be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low ambient light conditions (such as a darker room), an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight. An in-plane switching (IPS) LCD panel uses technology designed to resolve the quality issues inherent in TN panel technology, including strong viewing angle dependence and low-quality color reproduction. A liquid crystal display (LCD) panel is a type of display technology where the image is made up of liquid crystal cells controlled using electrical charges. The LCD panel is backlight by a cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) bulb. LCD panels are used on laptops and have replaced CRT monitors as the main type of computer display screen for desktops, as well. A light-emitting diode (LED) display is an LCD panel that uses a LED backlight instead of a CCFL backlight to provide its light source."

    "correct_answer": "MAN",
    "explanation": "A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan or city area. This usually works by providing municipal broadband via Wi-Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network. A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a wireless network topology where all nodes, including client stations, can provide forwarding and path discovery to improve coverage and throughput compared to using just fixed access points and extenders. The typical deployment design uses hundreds of wireless access points deployed outdoors, often on poles. A local area network (LAN) is a network where all the nodes or hosts participating in the network are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless media.

This usually occurs due to a memory failure or memory corruption in the system. The pinwheel is like the BSOD used in Windows. The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is a \"stop screen\" that appears when the Windows operating system detects a critical error and literally stops the system so that the error doesn't cause any loss of data. All operating systems have some form of \"stop screen,\" but the Windows version got the name BSOD since it was a screen with a full blue background and white text containing troubleshooting information and error codes."

    "correct_answer": "Coaxial",
    "explanation": "A coaxial cable is a cable used to transmit video, communications, and audio. A coaxial or coax cable is most commonly used as a cable to connect a TV to a cable TV service. Coaxial cables are a specialized type of copper cabling that uses a copper core to carry the electrical signal while being enclosed by plastic insulation and shielding to protect the data transmission from the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI). Plenum-rated cable has a special insulation that has low smoke and low flame characteristics. Plenum cable is mandated to be installed in any air handling space. Shielded cables contain a braided foil shield around the inner cabling to protect the data from the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI). An optical fiber consists of an ultra-fine core of glass to carry the light signals surrounded by glass or plastic cladding, which guides the light pulses along the core, and a protective coating. The fiber optic cable is contained in a protective jacket and terminated by a connector. Fiber optic cables use light signals to carry data across a cable at extremely high bandwidths."

    "correct_answer": "The 5.0 GHz frequency is less effective at penetrating solid surfaces than 2.4 GHz",
    "explanation": "The longer wavelength of 2.4 GHz makes it better at propagating through solid surfaces than the 5.0 GHz frequency. The 2.4 GHz frequency has a longer wavelength than the 5.0 GHz frequency. The longer wavelength gives it the ability to cover a longer range using the same power output levels as the 5.0 GHz frequency.

    "explanation": "A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection). An optical network terminal (ONT) is a device that connects fiber optics cables to other types of wiring such as Ethernet and phone lines by converting the signal from optical to electrical and vice versa. An ONT is commonly used with fiber to the house (FTTH) installations. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.

      "Aspect ratio",
      "Frame rate",
      "Resolution"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Refresh rate",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate is defined by the vertical scan frequency of a monitor and how many times in one second an image can be redrawn on the screen. LCD monitors have a fixed refresh rate based on the specifications of their panel. Generally, a monitor is rated with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, 72 Hz, or 120 Hz, with the higher refresh rate being considered better quality and easier on the user's eyes. For high-performance gaming systems, a 120 Hz monitor is desired for smoother motion and graphics. The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of width to height in a display. The frame rate is defined as the number of times the image in a video stream changes per second as expressed in Hertz (Hz) or Frames per Second (fps). The yaw rate is a made-up term for the exam and is used as a distractor in this question.

      "Split horizon",
      "Interference",
      "Throttling",
      "Latency"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Interference",
    "explanation": "Microwave links require a direct line of sight (LoS) between the antennas to maintain a strong and effective link. These line-of-sight microwave link uses highly directional transmitter and receiver antennas to communicate via a narrowly focused radio beam. Since this microwave-based network is being run in a wooded area, there are likely some trees or leaves that are blocking the line of sight between the antennas. To solve this issue, they should trim the trees and branches to provide a clear light of sight or move the antennas to reestablish a clear line of sight. Latency is the time delay between when a packet is sent and received. While latency will increase with an obstructed microwave line of sight link, latency is an effect of this issue and not the cause of the issue. Throttling is the intentional slowing or speeding of an internet service by an Internet service provider to regulate network traffic and minimize bandwidth congestion. This again is not a cause of intermittent connectivity, but would instead occur if the microwave link was overutilized beyond its SLA contract limitations. Split horizon is a form of route advertisement that prohibits a router from advertising back a route to the same interface from which it learned it. This does not affect the issues experienced with the microwave line. Another way to approach this question is to use the process of elimination: throttling slows down the speed, and latency slows down speed even further. Split horizon prevents loops, so it only makes sense that interference is the correct choice since interference can cause drops in connections in many situations."

The inverter is a small green board attached to the base of the LCD panel. In a laptop computer, the LCD screen relies on a backlight source to uniformly light up the screen, and the inverter acts as the power supply for this lighting source. If the inverter is faulty, the display will be too dim to easily see without an external light source like a flashlight.

    "explanation": "This blank screen asking for the administrative password appears to be a BIOS password required to be entered before the laptop is allowed to boot from the hard disk. Your best option is to clear the CMOS forcibly to remove the BIOS password from a workstation or laptop. To clear the CMOS, you must remove the CMOS battery from your computer, wait a few minutes, reinsert the CMOS battery, and then attempt to power on the computer again. This will cause the information stored in the CMOS (for example, BIOS settings and passwords) to be erased and restored to its default configuration. Removing and reinserting the laptop's battery will not reset the BIOS password. Disconnecting and reconnecting the hard drive will not reset the BIOS password."

Hosts can be allocated an IP address dynamically or be assigned a reserved IP address based on the host's MAC address. The server can also provide other configuration information, such as the location of DNS servers. A domain name system (DNS) server is a server that hosts the database of domain names and the IP addresses mapped to those names. Each DNS server is authoritative for certain domain names that their organization owns. An authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server is a server use to identify (authenticate), approve (authorize), and keep track of (account for) users and their actions. AAA servers can also be classified based on the protocol they use, such as a RADIUS server or TACACS+ server. A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server that provides that resource.

A mobile device can use its internal GPS, cellular, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi radios to identify its location. A GPS (global positioning system) device is used to determine a receiver's position on the Earth based on information received from 24 GPS satellites, which operate in a constellation in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The receiver must have a line-of-sight to four of the GPS satellites continuously to accurately determine its position on the earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude). The device's GPS receiver can provide an accurate location up to 10 meters. Cellular radios can provide an approximate location based upon the triangulation of your position between different cellular towers. Bluetooth can be used within a building to provide an accurate of the device within 3-4 meters. Wi-Fi positioning systems use the signal strength or angle of arrival of a signal to determine the device's location within 1-4 meters.

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a packet data communications specification providing an upgrade path for both GSM and CDMA2000 cellular networks. LTE has a theoretical speed of 150 Mbps and a real-world speed of around 20 Mbps. LTE Advanced (LTE-A) has a theoretical speed of 300 Mbps and a real-world speed of around 40 Mbps. 5G cellular technology is made up of three different types: low-band, mid-band, and high-band mmWave technology. Low-band 5G reaches an average speed of 55 Mbps with a theoretical speed of 150 Mbps. Mid-band 5G reaches an average speed of 150 Mbps with a theoretical speed of 1.5 Gbps. High-band 5G reaches an average speed of 3 Gbps with a theoretical speed of up to 70 Gbps."

    "question": "You have been asked to set up the corporate email on several mobile devices for Dion Training's employees. The employees will use their mobile devices to send their emails when out of the office. Which of the following mail protocols should you configure to allow the employees to send their mail?",
    "options": [
      "IMAP",
      "HTTPS",
      "SMTP",
      "POP3"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "SMTP",
    "explanation": "You should configure SMTP since it is the only protocol used to send emails. POP3 and IMAP are used to receive emails. HTTPS is used for web browsing, not for receiving emails. The post office protocol (POP3) is a TCP/IP application protocol providing a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server over port 110. The server usually deletes messages once the client has downloaded them. The internet message access protocol (IMAP) is a TCP/IP application protocol that provides a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server using TCP port number 143. Unlike POP3, messages persist on the server after the client has downloaded them. IMAP also supports mailbox management functions, such as creating subfolders and access to the same mailbox by more than one client at the same time. The simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is the protocol used to send mail between hosts on the Internet using TCP port 25. The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a secure protocol used to provide web content to browsers using SSL/TLS encryption over port 443."

    "options": [
      "SNMP",
      "TFTP",
      "HTTPS",
      "DHCP"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "HTTPS",
    "explanation": "The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a protocol in the TCP/IP suite that operates at the transport layer to provide connection-oriented, guaranteed delivery of packets. Hosts must first establish a session to exchange data and then confirm the delivery of packets using acknowledgments when using TCP. TCP is relatively slow in comparison to UDP. The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a secure protocol used to provide web content to browsers using SSL/TLS encryption over TCP port 443. The simple network management protocol (SNMP) is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices over UDP ports 161 and 162. A management system collates data sent by agents running on each device. The agents maintain a Management Information Base of configuration and usage data. An agent can also generate a trap, alerting the management system of some notable event (such as a printer that is out of paper). The trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) is a protocol used to get a file from a remote host or put a file onto a remote host. TFTP is commonly used with embedded devices or systems that retrieve firmware, configuration information, or a system image during the boot process. TFTP operates over UDP port 69. The dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to allocate IP addresses to a host when it joins a network. DHCP utilizes UDP ports 67 and 68."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A virtual machine has less downtime than a physical server",
    "explanation": "A virtual machine can usually be restored much faster than a physical server. Physical servers must be modified to fit the right drivers for the disk drives, NIC, and other necessary components whenever they must be rebuilt after a crash. Often, a new physical server will also be required to replace a faulty one, and then the right drivers are needed to ensure a smooth transition. Conversely, a virtual machine can be recreated using another instance, clone, or restoration from a backup in much less time. Therefore, the downtime associated with virtual machines and their restoral is much lower."

First, you powered the computer off and on again, noting that the fans were spinning, but there was still no display output. You confirmed that the monitor and video cable were working by testing them with another computer. Next, you re-seated the PCIe x16 video card and tried a different video card, but the issue persisted. You checked all power connections inside the case to ensure they were secure. Finally, you tested the computer with minimal components (motherboard, processor, one stick of RAM, and power supply), but there was still no display and no POST beep codes. Given the steps taken, what is the MOST likely cause of the issue?",
    "options": [
      "The power supply's voltage switch is set to 240V but the power outlet is providing 110V",
      "The power supply wattage is too low for the components in the computer",
      "The motherboard has failed and needs to be replaced",
      "The CMOS battery needs to be replaced"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "The power supply wattage is too low for the components in the computer",
    "explanation": "If the power supply does not provide enough power, the system may turn on partially (fans spinning) but not fully power the components needed to display output or perform a POST (Power-On Self-Test), therefore no beep codes would be present. A motherboard failure is still possible; however, it would most likely cause a POST beep code if the other components are functioning properly. This is less likely because the fans spinning indicate that the motherboard is receiving at least some power as they use low wattage, with the additional findings suggesting a power supply issue. If the power supply's voltage switch is set incorrectly (e.g., to 240V while the power outlet provides 110V), the computer components would likely not turn on at all (no fans spinning), or the power supply would immediately fail. A dead CMOS battery can cause BIOS settings to reset, but it typically does not prevent the computer from displaying output or performing a POST. The computer should still boot with default BIOS settings."

It has been working well for about 3 weeks, but today she has brought it into your store for repair because it is not working properly. When she touches an icon on the screen, the program fails to load. You look over the laptop, and the screen appears to be fully intact with no dark blobs or spider web cracks in the panel. You attempt to operate the laptop using the touchscreen, but it appears non-responsive to your touch. You can, however, click on the icons using the laptop's touchpad without any issues. Which of the following components MOST likely needs to be replaced?",
    "options": [
      "LCD panel",
      "Inverter",
      "GPU",
      "Digitizer"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Digitizer",
    "explanation": "The digitizer is a touch-sensitive glass panel covering the LCD in a touchscreen assembly. The digitizer is used to convert touch events to digital signals that can be interpreted as different types of input. The digitizer can be touched and inspected without taking apart the device. A liquid crystal display (LCD) panel is a type of display technology where the image is made up of liquid crystal cells controlled using electrical charges. The LCD panel is backlight by a cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) bulb. LCD panels are used on laptops and have replaced CRT monitors as the main type of computer display screen for desktops, as well. The LCD screen is the panel that is inside the device, which displays the image. You cannot get to the LCD without taking the device apart first. When only the touch screen is broken, you should still see what is happening on the screen, and the screen should still function as normal. When only the LCD is broken, you can still use the touchscreen, but the panel will have dark blobs or spider web cracks (or both). When both LCD and touchscreen are damaged, you may still be able to use portions of the touchscreen, and some parts of the LCD may display the image, but you will incur obvious difficulties in using the device as normal. The inverter (also known as inverter board, screen inverter, or LCD inverter) is a part of the laptop's display assembly. The inverter is a small green board attached to the base of the LCD panel. In a laptop computer, the LCD screen relies on a backlight source to uniformly light up the screen, and the inverter acts as the power supply for this lighting source. If the inverter is faulty, the display will be too dim to easily see without an external light source like a flashlight. A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a microprocessor used on dedicated video adapter cards or within a CPU with integrated graphics capability to handle the mathematical calculations required to create immersive and 3D graphics."

    "correct_answer": "Replace the DC jack",
    "explanation": "This scenario indicates that the DC jack is faulty. Since the battery was replaced and the laptop continues to work, this indicates it isn't a battery issue but is, instead, most likely a DC jack issue.

    "correct_answer": "Zigbee",
    "explanation": "Zigbee is an open-source wireless communication protocol used for home automation. Zigbee is open-source, unlike Z-Wave, which is proprietary. Zigbee uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. This higher frequency allows more data bandwidth at the expense of range than Z-Wave and the greater risk of interference from other 2.4 GHz radio communications. Zigbee supports more overall devices within a single network (65,000 compared to 232 for Z-wave), and there is no hop limit for communication between devices. Z-wave is a low-power wireless communications protocol used primarily for home automation. Z-wave uses radio frequencies in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz frequency ranges. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific, and medical radio bands from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz and building a personal area network (PAN). Bluetooth is commonly used when connecting wireless devices like mice, trackpads, headphones, and other devices. Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other.

    "explanation": "Based on the symptoms described, the RAID itself is fully functional, so the RAID controller is not causing any problems. This could be caused by a failing hard drive or the system overheating due to the slow performance. Since there is a clicking noise, this is most likely a hard drive failure since a cooling fan makes a whirring or grinding noise instead. Therefore, we can assume the RAID is made up of magnetic hard drives, and one of those hard disks is starting to fail. To replace the hard drive, you need to find a comparable drive that will work in the array, reboot the computer, and enter the RAID setup program to rebuild the array after replacing that hard drive.

    "correct_answer": "Input voltage",
    "explanation": "This question provides you with many details, but the key phrase in finding the answer is in the first sentence. This computer will be traveling worldwide, and the most important consideration will be the input voltage. If you choose a 120-volt power supply, it would be destroyed if plugged into a 240-volt outlet (commonly used outside the United States). Conversely, if you use a 240-volt power supply and plug it into a 120-volt outlet, it will not function due to the lower voltage. Therefore, you need to pick a power supply with dual voltage selection capability for maximum compatibility worldwide."

    "explanation": "An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a form of network security that detects and prevents identified threats. Intrusion prevention systems continuously monitor your network, looking for possible malicious incidents, and capturing information about them. An IPS can block malicious network traffic, unlike an IDS, which can only log them. A proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. System Logging Protocol (Syslog) uses port 514 and is a way network devices can use a standard message format to communicate with a logging server. It was designed specifically to make it easy to monitor network devices. Devices can use a Syslog agent to send out notification messages under a wide range of specific conditions."

      "APIPA"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Dynamic",
    "explanation": "A dynamic IP address should be used for client workstations and devices to ensure they are easy to configure and less prone to human error. When configuring a dynamic IP address, the DHCP server should issue the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server's IP address to the workstation or device. A static IP address should be used for servers to ensure they are easy to find, access, and manage on the network. When configuring a static IP address, you need to include the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server's IP address. A static IP address is used when the DHCP server is disabled and clients are configured manually to join the network properly. Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform that function. When a host uses an APIPA address, it can communicate with other hosts on the same network using APIPA. Still, it cannot reach other networks or communicate with hosts who have managed to obtain a valid DHCP lease. An APIPA address is also known as a link-local address."

      "PCIe x16",
      "AGP"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "PCIe x1",
    "explanation": "PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) is an interface standard for connecting high-speed components. Every desktop PC motherboard has several PCIe slots you can use to add GPUs (video cards or graphics cards), RAID cards, network adapters, Wi-Fi cards, or SSD (solid-state drive) add-on cards. The types of PCIe slots available in your PC will depend on your motherboard and are designated as PCIe x1, x4, x8, and x16. Network adapters and Wi-Fi network cards almost exclusively rely on PCIe x1 expansion slots or a USB connection for their connectivity. Graphics cards usually rely on a PCIe x16 expansion slot. eSATA is an external SATA port used to connect an external storage device such as a hard drive. The accelerated graphics port (AGP) is a parallel expansion card standard that was originally designed for attaching a video card to a computer system to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. AGP has been replaced with PCle due to its faster speeds."

    "options": [
      "VM Sprawl",
      "Metered services",
      "On-Demand",
      "Rapid elasticity"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Rapid elasticity",
    "explanation": "Rapid elasticity can be a security threat to your organization's data due to data remanences. Data remanence is the residual representation of digital data that remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase it. So, when a cloud resource is deprovisioned and returned to the cloud service provider, it can be issued to another organization for use. If the data was not properly erased from the underlying storage, it could be exposed to the other organization. For this reason, all cloud-based storage drives should be encrypted by default to prevent data remanence from being read by others. Metered services are pre-paid, a-la-carte, pay-per-use, or committed offerings. A metered service like a database may charge its users based on the actual usage of the service resources on an hourly or monthly basis. For example, Dion Training used the AWS Lambda serverless product in some of our automation. This service charges us $0.20 for every 1 million requests processed. VM Sprawl involves the creation of VM without proper authorization. This wouldn't cause issues with data remnants. On-demand refers to the fact that a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider."

This is commonly used for contactless payment systems, transferring contacts, or transferring a file from one device to another. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific, and medical radio bands from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz and building a personal area network (PAN). Bluetooth is commonly used when connecting wireless devices like mice, trackpads, headphones, and other devices. Infrared (IR) was a wireless networking standard supporting speeds up to about 4 Mbps with a direct line of sight for communications. Infrared sensors are used in mobile devices and with IR blasters to control appliances. While infrared (IR) used to be commonly used to connect wireless mice and keyboards to a laptop in the 1990s, it has fallen out of favor in the last 10-15 years since Bluetooth is more reliable and does not require a direct line of sight between the device and the laptop. Wi-Fi is the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networking based on spread spectrum radio transmission in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The standard has six main iterations (a, b, g, n, ac, and ax), describing different modulation techniques, supported distances, and data rates."

Certain services may need to be made publicly accessible from the Internet (such as a web, email, or Minecraft server) and they should be installed in the perimeter network instead of in your intranet. If communication is required between hosts on either side of a perimeter network, then a host within the perimeter network will act as a proxy to take the request. If the request is valid, it re-transmits it to the destination. External hosts have no idea about what is behind the perimeter network so that the intranet remains secure. A perimeter network can be implemented using either two firewalls (screened subnet) or a single three-legged firewall (one with three network ports). In this SOHO network, it would use a single three-legged firewall approach to separate the perimeter network from the LAN and WAN.

It is often used for reimaging computers in corporate deployments. To boot from the hard drive instead, the BIOS's boot order should be changed from PXE to HDD. Rebooting the workstation will just reload the PXE-based OS again. Since the system is booting to the PXE environment, it is bypassing the internal hard drive's OS making recovery mode an invalid choice."

    "correct_answer": "Static",
    "explanation": "OBJ-2.5: A static IP address should be used for servers to ensure they are easy to find, access, and manage on the network. When configuring a static IP address, you need to include the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server's IP address. A static IP address is used when the DHCP server is disabled and clients are configured manually to join the network properly. A dynamic IP address is configured automatically by a DHCP server when a new host joins the network. Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform that function. When a host uses an APIPA address, it can communicate with other hosts on the same network using APIPA. Still, it cannot reach other networks or communicate with hosts who have managed to obtain a valid DHCP lease. An APIPA address is also known as a link-local address."

    "correct_answer": "VDI",
    "explanation": "OBJ-4.1: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) refers to using a VM as a means of provisioning corporate desktops. In a typical VDI, desktop computers are replaced by low-spec, low-power thin client computers. When the thin client starts, it boots a minimal OS, allowing the user to log on to a VM stored on the company server or cloud infrastructure. The user connects to the VM using some remote desktop protocol (Microsoft Remote Desktop or Citrix ICA, for instance). The thin client has to find the correct image and use an appropriate authentication mechanism. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables a service provider to make applications available over the Internet to end-users. This can be a calendar, scheduling, invoicing, word processor, database, or other programs. For example, Google Docs and Office 365 are both word processing SaaS solutions. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables consumers to rent fully configured systems that are set up for specific purposes.

    "explanation": "OBJ-5.7: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) performance optimization can help a business improve the quality of its video and audio communications over the Internet by decreasing the size of the broadcast domain through the creation of VLANs. Each VLAN can contain the VoIP devices for a single department or business unit, and traffic is routed between the VLANs using layer 3 multilayer switches to increase the performance of the voice communication systems. Performance optimization helps companies bolster the availability, accessibility, security, and overall performance of their networks. Compliance enforcement involves dividing up one network into smaller sections to better control the flow of traffic across the network and to restrict confidential data to a specific network segment based on a specific regulation or contractual requirement, such as PCI DSS segmentation requirements. A honeynet is an intentionally vulnerable network segment that is used to observe and investigate the attack techniques of a hacker or adversary. Separate public/private networking involves segmenting the network into two portions: public and private. This is often used in cloud architectures to protect private data."

    "correct_answer": "Natalie should log into her corporate email account on the new Android phone and restore her contacts and appointments to the new device",
    "explanation": "OBJ-1.4: Since Natalie has a corporate account used to synchronize data from her device to the cloud, the easier and quickest method would be to fully synchronize her contacts and appointments to her corporate cloud-based account from her old device first. Then, she can configure her new Android device to access her corporate account. It will automatically download and synchronize the data from the cloud-based servers onto her new Android device. Moving data over Bluetooth from an iPhone to an Android can be complicated, so using the cloud synchronization option would be easier and faster. You cannot use iTunes to move data from an iPhone to an Android device since iTunes only supports iPhone and iPad devices. While NFC can transfer data between two phones that are placed close together, it is not the optimal way to transmit large amounts of data such as all of the contacts or appointments from a previous phone."

Since we already established that the cables were properly connected, we have to consider the firmware as the issue. To troubleshoot this issue, you should restart the computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI configuration. If the BIOS/UEFI does not recognize the hard drive, then the motherboard's firmware will need to be updated.

Unfortunately, when this was first released, the radios to operate with this standard were fairly expensive, so it did not sell well or become widespread. The 802.11b (Wireless B) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 11 Mbps. The 802.11g (Wireless G) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 54 Mbps. The 802.11n (Wireless N) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 108 Mbps or a 5.0 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 600 Mbps. Wireless N supports the use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology to use multiple antennas to transmit and receive data at higher speeds. Wireless N supports channel bonding by combining two 20 MHz channels into a single 40 MHz channel to provide additional bandwidth. The 802.11ac (Wireless AC or Wi-Fi 5) standard utilizes a 5 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at theoretical speeds up to 3.5 Gbps. Wireless AC uses channel bonding to create a single channel of up to 160 MHz to provide additional bandwidth. Wireless AC uses multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technology to use multiple antennas to transmit and receive data at higher speeds. The 802.11ax (Wireless AX or Wi-Fi 6) standard utilizes 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies to provide wireless networking at theoretical speeds up to 9.6 Gbps. Wireless AC uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) to conduct multiplexing of the frequencies transmitted and received to each client to provide additional bandwidth.

Unlike POP3, messages persist on the server after the client has downloaded them. IMAP also supports mailbox management functions, such as creating subfolders and access to the same mailbox by more than one client at the same time. The post office protocol (POP3) is a TCP/IP application protocol providing a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server over port 110. The server usually deletes messages once the client has downloaded them.

Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform that function. APIPA serves as a DHCP server failover mechanism and makes it easier to configure and support small local area networks (LANs). If no DHCP server is currently available, either because the server is temporarily down or because none exists on the network, the computer selects an IP address from a range of addresses (from 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255) reserved for that purpose."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Rapid elasticity",
    "explanation": "OBJ-4.1: Rapid elasticity allows users to automatically request additional space in the cloud or other types of services. Because of the setup of cloud computing services, provisioning can be seamless for the client or user. Providers still need to allocate and de-allocate resources that are often irrelevant on the client or user's side. This feature allows a service to be scaled up without purchasing, installing, and configuring new hardware, unlike if you had to install more physical storage into a server or datacenter. Resource pooling refers to the concept that allows a virtual environment to allocate memory and processing capacity for a VMs use. Metered services are pre-paid, a-la-carte, pay-per-use, or committed offerings. A metered service like a database may charge its users based on the actual usage of the service resources on an hourly or monthly basis. For example, Dion Training used the AWS Lambda serverless product in some of our automation. This service charges us $0.20 for every 1 million requests processed.

Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction. Repeaters may be wired or wireless, and they rebroadcast whatever signal is received through their transmitter. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. A switch is a network device that receives incoming data into a buffer, then the destination MAC address is compared with an address table so that data is only sent out to the port with the corresponding MAC address. In a switched network, each port is in a separate collision domain. A router is a network device that links dissimilar networks and can support multiple alternate paths between locations based upon the parameters of speed, traffic loads, and cost.

    "correct_answer": "TN",
    "explanation": "OBJ-1.2: A twisted nematic (TN) LCD panel uses technology where the panel is black when no electric current is running through the liquid crystal cells because the cells align themselves in a twisted state. When an electric current is applied, the liquid crystal cells untwist, allowing light to pass through, resulting in a white display screen. TN displays can be made with high refresh rates of 120 Hz or 144 Hz which makes them popular with gamers. An in-plane switching (IPS) LCD panel uses technology designed to resolve the quality issues inherent in TN panel technology, including strong viewing angle dependence and low-quality color reproduction. IPS displays have great color accuracy, but they do not support higher refresh rates sought after by gamers. A vertical alignment (VA) LCD panel uses technology designed to have liquid crystals lay perpendicular to the glass substrate when power is removed and in a vertical position when voltage is applied. This allows light to move through the liquid pixels when voltage is applied and the image is then produced. VA displays are a good middle-ground between IPS and TN panel displays.

This is commonly used for contactless payment systems, transferring contacts, or transferring a file from one device to another. Wi-Fi is the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networking based on spread spectrum radio transmission in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The standard has six main iterations (a, b, g, n, ac, and ax), describing different modulation techniques, supported distances, and data rates.

This computer is expected to generate a lot of heat during its operations. Which of the following solutions would MOST efficiently dissipate all of the heat produced?",
    "options": [
      "Replace the power supply with a more efficient model",
      "Passive heat sink",
      "Liquid cooling system",
      "High RPM fans"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Liquid cooling system",
    "explanation": "OBJ-3.4: Since the system described in the question will have multiple graphics cards (GPUs), lots of memory, and an 8-core CPU, it is expected to generate a lot of heat during its crypto mining operation. For any extremely high-powered processing environment that generates a lot of heat (for example, gaming workstations), liquid cooling becomes the MOST efficient way to dissipate the system's heat. A heat sink is a block of copper or aluminum with fins. A cooling effect occurs when convection is achieved using passive cooling as the fins expose a larger surface area to the air around the component. Fans are used to dissipate the heat generated by the processors by increasing the airflow across the components. Replacing the power supply with a more efficient model can reduce some of the heat generated by the power supply, but it will not reduce the heat generated by the CPU or the graphics cards."

You have been asked to select a technology that would allow employees to work remotely from their homes during poor weather conditions. Which of the following should you select?",
    "options": [
      "IDS",
      "VPN",
      "VLAN",
      "NAT"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "VPN",
    "explanation": "OBJ-2.6: A remote-access VPN connection allows an individual user to connect to a private network from a remote location using a laptop or desktop computer connected to the internet. A remote-access VPN allows individual users to establish secure connections with a remote computer network. Once established, the remote user can access the corporate network and its capabilities as if they were accessing the network from their own office spaces. Network address translation (NAT) is a network service provided by a router or proxy server to map private local addresses to one or more publicly accessible IP addresses. NAT can use static mappings but is commonly implemented as network port address translation (PAT) or NAT overloading, where a few public IP addresses are mapped to multiple LAN hosts using port allocations. A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logically separate network that is created using switching technology. Even though hosts on two VLANs may be physically connected to the same cabling, local traffic is isolated to each VLAN so they must use a router to communicate. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or system for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. Unlike an IPS, which can stop malicious activity or policy violations, an IDS can only log these issues and not stop them."

    ],
    "correct_answer": "Schedule an authorized downtime period, replace physical disk 3, rebuild the array, and confirm that the RAID is no longer reporting itself as degraded",
    "explanation": "Since a RAID 5 has some built-in redundancy, it will continue to operate while in this degraded state without any additional redundancy since one of the drives has failed. It is best to schedule an authorized downtime period, replace the failed drive, rebuild the array, and confirm that the RAID is no longer reporting itself as degraded. During the rebuilding of the array, the system may perform extremely slowly, and users may experience a loss of service, which is why scheduling some downtime is necessary. Formatting the logical drive or changing a RAID 5 to a RAID 0 will cause data loss, and therefore they are not the correct answers."

This can be configured under the Display settings in Windows 10. Refresh rate is the measure of how fast an image can be updated on a monitor or display. If a monitor has a lower refresh rate, then blurring and ghosting can occur. Color depth defines how many unique colors can be displayed by the projected image at once. Most monitors have a default or native resolution. When you first connect a monitor to a Windows workstation, this native resolution is detected, and Windows attempts to configure itself automatically. If this creates an imbalance between the two monitors, a technician can adjust the screen's resolution by changing it in the Display settings area of Windows 10."

Most modern printers will also indicate the amount of toner left using their on-screen display and present a warning message for low toner and an error message when the printer is completely out of toner. With color laser printers, there are four different toner colors used during printing: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. If only the black appears to be faded, it is possible that it is running low on toner. This is a common problem since most employees print more black and white documents than color documents which leads to the black toner normally running out before the other colors."

A signature capture pad is a device that electronically captures a person's handwritten signature on an LCD touchpad using a pen-type stylus. Once captured, digital signatures can be imported into and used with most ID software and security programs. Signatures can also be digitally stored for future use. Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. This is commonly used for contactless payment systems, transferring contacts, or transferring a file from one device to another. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific, and medical radio bands from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz and building a personal area network (PAN). Bluetooth is commonly used when connecting wireless devices like mice, trackpads, headphones, and other devices. A touchpad is an input device used on most laptops to replace a mouse.

    "explanation": "Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of data packets over a network connection occurs. Jitter is a big problem for any real-time applications you may be supporting on your networks, like video conferences, voice-over IP, and virtual desktop infrastructure clients. A jitter is simply a variation in the delay of the packets, and this can cause some strange side effects, especially for voice and video calls. If you have ever been in a video conference where someone was speaking and then their voice started speeding up for 5 or 10 seconds, then returned to normal speed, you have been on the receiving end of their network's jitter. Latency is the measure of time that it takes for data to reach its destination across a network. Usually, we measure network latency as the round-trip time from a workstation to the distant end and back. Throughput is an actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from the source to a destination. Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given network. Now, bandwidth is more of a theoretical concept that measures how much data could be transferred from a source to a destination under ideal conditions.

    "correct_answer": "512 GB SSD",
    "explanation": "Based on the system specifications, the system's slowest part appears to be the 5400 RPM hard disk drive (HDD). Therefore, replacing the HDD with a solid-state device (SSD) would dramatically increase the loading speeds as the operating system and other programs are read from the storage device during bootup and when loading programs. Another viable option would be to purchase a faster HDD, such as operating at 7200 RPM or 10,000 RPM. Still, though, an SSD would be faster than a higher RPM HDD, so it remains the best answer. If the laptop had 4GB or less of memory then it would be appropriate to increase the memory to 8GB or 16GB to increase the speed.

      "Duplex"
    ],
    "explanation": "Duplex printing is a feature of some computer printers, multi-function printers (MFPs), and copy machines that allow the printing of a sheet of paper on both sides automatically. Without this capability, print devices can only print on a single side of the paper, sometimes called single-sided printing or simplex printing. With duplex printing, information is printed on the front side of a piece of paper, and then the paper is automatically fed back through the printer to print the information on the backside of the paper. Page orientation is how a rectangular page is oriented for normal viewing. The two most common types of orientation are portrait (taller rather than wider) and landscape (wider rather than taller). The collate setting allows the gathering and arranging of individual sheets or other printed components into a pre-determined sequence. Collating creates consistent, logical sets from multiple parts, such as printing a series of pages in a report like pages 1, 2, 3 before printing the second copy. This makes it easier to staple and distribute to people after coming out of the printer. The term transparency was made up as a distractor for this question."

    "explanation": "A fiber optic cable is a network cable that contains strands of glass fibers inside an insulated casing. They're designed for long-distance, high-performance data networking, and telecommunications. If you are dealing with connecting two networks over a long distance (over a few hundred meters), you should use a fiber optic cable. Shielded and plenum copper cables can only cover a distance of approximately 100 meters in length. Coaxial cables can cover a maximum distance of 200 to 500 meters in length."

    "explanation": "Defragging is a simple process when file fragments are put together to speed up file access. File fragments are put together, and quality defragmentation utilities also assemble the free space into a single block to prevent future fragmentation. By defragmenting the hard drive, the server doesn't have to spend as much time accessing the information, and it can boot up faster. Based on the clicking noises, it sounds like the system has to access many parts of the drive to load the files."

An ACL is a list that shows which traffic or devices should be allowed into or denied from accessing the network. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. An IDS uses signatures, not ACLs. Content filtering is the use of a program to screen and/or exclude access to web pages or emails deemed objectionable.

If you are doing something that must get to the destination without errors or data loss, such as a banking transaction or stock trade, it should be sent over TCP. The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a protocol in the TCP/IP suite that operates at the transport layer to provide connection-oriented, guaranteed delivery of packets. Hosts must first establish a session to exchange data and then confirm the delivery of packets using acknowledgments when using TCP. TCP is relatively slow in comparison to UDP."

    "explanation": "It is essential to read the owner's manual before starting anything. The next step is to document all screws and locations because lots of these tiny screws are not equal and have different depths. If you don't document which screws go into which holes, you could insert them into the wrong place and waste a lot of time or cause damage to the laptop.

A technician examines the laptop and does not smell any unusual odors coming from it. Which of the following is MOST likely causing the laptop to intermittently shut down?",
    "options": [
      "The laptop's CMOS battery has failed",
      "The laptop has inadequate airflow and is overheating",
      "The laptop's battery connection is loose",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "The laptop has inadequate airflow and is overheating"
    ],
    "explanation": "If the laptop had inadequate airflow, it intermittently shuts down at random times. Since the laptop shuts down faster if more intensive processor tasks are performed, this also indicates an overheating issue when the heat from the processor cannot be dissipated fast enough. If a laptop has a swollen capacitor, then a technician will smell a foul odor coming from the motherboard. A swollen capacitor indicates a motherboard failure that can lead to strange issues occurring on the laptop. If the laptop loses power when moved, this is most likely a loose battery connection. If the CMOS battery has failed, then it would cause the laptop to lose its date/time settings."

    "explanation": "A WiFi analyzer can determine the wireless network's signal strength, the frequencies in use, and any possible radio frequency interference. Based on the issue described in the question, the network may have dead zones that could be fixed by adding additional access points to increase the network's wireless coverage. Another possible issue could be radio frequency interference from other devices, which a WiFi analyzer could help identify. A cable tester is used to ensure a cable is properly created as a patch cable (straight through) or a crossover cable. Cable testers provide detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of the cable. For example, they test and report cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, and other cable run characteristics. A multimeter can measure the voltage, amperage, and resistance of a circuit. A multimeter can be a hand-held device useful for basic fault finding and field service work or a bench instrument that can measure electricity with a high degree of accuracy. A tone generator is connected to a wall jack and sends a repeating signal over the cable. The probe can then be used to detect which cable is attached to the wall jack by detecting the signal being sent by the tone generator. The probe needs to be near or touch the cable with the tone generator attached to identify it positively."

    "explanation": "A proxy server takes a whole HTTP request from a client, checks it, then forwards it to the destination computer on the Internet. When the reply comes back, it checks it and then shuttles it back to the LAN computer. A proxy can be used for other types of traffic too. A proxy server can usually operate either as a transparent service, in which case the client requires no special configuration or as a non-transparent service that requires configuration. A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server that provides that resource. A proxy server can be used to filter content and websites from reaching a user. A file server is used to host and control access to shared files and folders for the organization. A dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server is a server configured with a range of addresses to lease. Hosts can be allocated an IP address dynamically or be assigned a reserved IP address based on the host's MAC address. The server can also provide other configuration information, such as the location of DNS servers. A domain name system (DNS) server is a server that hosts the database of domain names and the IP addresses mapped to those names.

Usually, the alphanumeric side is split into function keys (F1 to F12), followed by numeric keys (0-9), and then alphabetic keys (A-Z). To fix this, the fastest way to do this is to turn off NumLock using your laptop keyboard. If you hit the NumLock key, it will turn off.

The IOPS is calculated based on the physical constraints of the media being used. For a hard disk drive, the IOPS is calculated by dividing 1000 milliseconds by the combined average seek time and average latency. The seek time only applies to a traditional hard drive since it calculates the time it takes to move the head to the proper storage location on the platter.

    "options": [
      "By leasing a set of reserved IP addresses according to their category",
      "By assigning options to the computers on the network by priority",
      "By matching a MAC address to an IP address within the DHCP scope",
      "By letting the network switches assign IP addresses from a reserved pool"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "By matching a MAC address to an IP address within the DHCP scope"
    ],
    "explanation": "When the client requests an IP address by sending a message on the network to the DHCP server, the DHCP server will assign an IP from its DHCP scope to the client and reserve it based on its MAC address. DHCP reservations allow the DHCP server to pre-set an IP address to a specific client based on its MAC address. This ensures that the client will always get the same IP address from the DHCP server when it connects to the network. DHCP reservations are usually used with servers or printers on your internal network and are rarely used with end-user or client devices."

    "options": [
      "Voltmeter",

      "Toner probe",
      "Multimeter"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Multimeter"
    ],
    "explanation": "A multimeter can measure the voltage, amperage, and resistance of a circuit. If you use the lowest ohms (resistance) setting, you can touch the multimeter's black lead to a grounded metal surface and touch the red lead to each circuit wire. If you get a meter reading of zero ohms (low resistance), this indicates that the circuit is properly grounded. If you get a meter reading of infinity, O.L., Open Loop, or a needle that pegs high on the meter, this indicates an open circuit with no path to ground. A voltmeter can only measure the voltage, not the amperage or resistance of the circuit. A loopback plug is used to test a port. When you connect a loopback plug to a port, you should see a solid connection LED. You can also use the loopback plug in conjunction with diagnostic software. A tone generator is connected to a wall jack and sends a repeating signal over the cable. The probe can then be used to detect which cable is attached to the wall jack by detecting the signal being sent by the tone generator. The probe needs to be near or touch the cable with the tone generator attached to identify it positively."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "DSL"
    ],
    "explanation": "DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection). \"Fiber to the X\" (FTTx) is commonly used to describe where the fiber connection ends between the service and the subscriber. The closer the fiber is to the user's network, the faster the service. FTTH (fiber to the house) provides fiber directly to the user's home network making it the fastest option. Traditionally, you will find a 1 Gbps connection or higher with FTTH. FTTN (fiber to the node) or FTTC (fiber to the curb/cabinet) provides fiber only to the local area or neighborhood but then uses copper cabling from the node/cabinet/curb to the home network, which slows down the network (generally, 100-200 Mbps). HFC (Hybrid Fiber Coax) is similar to FTTN/FTTC, except that coaxial cable is used from the cabinet to the home to increase the speed (generally 300-500 Mbps). A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. Satellite systems provide far bigger areas of coverage than can be achieved using other technologies. A Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) microwave antenna is aligned to an orbital satellite that can either relay signals between sites directly or via another satellite."

      "PaaS"
    ],
    "explanation": "Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection. PaaS includes infrastructure (servers, storage, and networking) and middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more. PaaS allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators, or the development tools and other resources. You manage the applications and services you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables a consumer to outsource computing equipment purchases and running their own data center. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables a service provider to make applications available over the Internet to end-users. This can be a calendar, scheduling, invoicing, word processor, database, or other programs. For example, Google Docs and Office 365 are both word processing SaaS solutions. Desktop as a Service (DaaS) provides a full virtualized desktop environment from within a cloud-based service. This is also known as VDI (Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure) and is coming in large enterprise businesses focused on increasing their security and minimizing their operational expenses."

    "explanation": "Port forwarding occurs when a router takes requests from the Internet for a particular application, such as HTTP/port 80), and sends them to a designated host on the local area network. This question did not mention that Wi-Fi was being used in the 2.4 GHz frequency range, therefore using channels 1, 6, and 11 is not required to minimize interference. The dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to allocate IP addresses to a host when it joins a network. DHCP does not need to be configured to use a server and most servers use static IP addresses instead of dynamic ones.

      "Tray"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Tray"
    ],
    "explanation": "The tray setting is used to define what type of paper is being used by a printer. The tray setting is commonly set to auto, letter in the United States, or A4 in Europe. The quality setting is used to define the overall output characteristics of the print job. If the best setting is used, the printer will use more ink/toner in producing the image and printer more slowly. If the Fast, Draft, or Low settings are used, the printer will use less ink/toner and print more quickly. Page orientation is how a rectangular page is oriented for normal viewing. The two most common types of orientation are portrait and landscape. Duplex printing is a feature of some computer printers, multi-function printers (MFPs), and copy machines that allow the printing of a sheet of paper on both sides automatically. Without this capability, print devices can only print on a single side of the paper, sometimes called single-sided printing or simplex printing. With duplex printing, information is printed on the front side of a piece of paper, and then the paper is automatically fed back through the printer to print the information on the backside of the paper."

One method of doing this is to connect the laptop to the device using a USB cable, and then it can be used as a wired network connection. A portable hotspot is a dedicated mobile device that connects to a cellular network and provides a wireless (Wi-Fi) network for a small number of users. A tunneling (or encapsulation) protocol wraps up data from one protocol for transfer over a different type of network. For example, PPP can carry TCP/IP data over a dial-up line, enabling a remote computer to communicate with the LAN. A baseband update is the modification of the firmware of a cellular modem."

The computer will still pass the POST, but it will be unable to load an operating system since there is no boot device found. If the CPU power cable was unplugged, the CPU would not receive power and the POST would not complete. If the motherboard power cable was not connected, then the motherboard's LED would not be lit.

A UTM centralizes the threat management service, providing simpler configuration and reporting than isolated applications spread across several servers or devices. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or system for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. Unlike an IPS, which can stop malicious activity or policy violations, an IDS can only log these issues and not stop them. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) conducts the same functions as an IDS but can also block or take actions against malicious events.

The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public. Private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of a public cloud including self-service, scalability, and elasticity with the additional control and customization available from dedicated resources over a computing infrastructure hosted on-premises. Private clouds also deliver a higher level of security and privacy through both company firewalls and internal hosting to ensure operations and sensitive data are not accessible to third-party providers. A public cloud contains services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet and is available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.

    "explanation": "The purpose of Secure Boot is to prevent malicious and unauthorized apps from loading into the operating system (OS) during the startup process. Secure Boot is enabled by default in Windows 10. When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software, including UEFI firmware drivers (also known as Option ROMs), EFI applications, and the operating system. If the signatures are valid, the PC boots and the firmware gives control to the operating system. The OEM can use instructions from the firmware manufacturer to create Secure boot keys and to store them in the PC firmware. When you add UEFI drivers, you'll also need to make sure these are signed and included in the Secure Boot database. Full disk encryption is used to encrypt the user and system data stored in the device's internal storage. RAM integrity checking is conducted by default on most systems during the initial boot process but it doesn't check the contents of the memory for malware. The BIOS password would prevent the system from booting up without the correct password being entered, but this would not prevent unauthorized applications from being installed during the bootup process."

    "explanation": "An SSD (Solid-State Drive) is limited in the total number of write functions that can occur over its lifespan. Due to the immediate ability of an SSD to locate data on the drive (since there is no spinning platter that must be moved to reach the right area to retrieve the data like a regular magnetic hard drive), there is no need to defragment an SSD. When you defrag a hard drive, especially an SSD, it will cause tons of small write accesses, reducing the hard drive's lifespan. And since data is not being read sequentially, it doesn't matter if the file is stored in a hundred different places; the performance will remain the same. Therefore, you should disable any regularly scheduled defragmentation tasks when using an SSD to extend its lifespan."

A computer is connected to a wall jack in this cable system and then connected to a patch panel by cabling running through the walls. A pre-wired RJ-45 port on the patch panel is then connected to a port on the switch using a straight-through or patch cable. A router is a network device that links dissimilar networks and can support multiple alternate paths between locations based upon the parameters of speed, traffic loads, and cost. Routers are used to logically divide networks into subnets. A wireless access point (WAP), or access point, connects directly to a wired local area network and the AP then provides wireless connections using Wi-Fi for other devices to use that wired connection. An AP supports the connection of multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection. A hub provides no intelligence in its interconnection functions so that whatever is received on one port is repeated out every other port. This leads to many collisions occurring on the hub and increases the number of rebroadcasts which can slow down the entire network."

Since there was no dust noticed, this cannot be the whining source, and instead, you should apply oil to the bearings. Over time, dust can get into the fan bearings, causing increased friction when spinning and creating a whining sound. If this doesn't solve the noise, then you would replace the case fans."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Rapid elasticity"
    ],
    "explanation": "Rapid elasticity is used to describe scalable provisioning or the capability to provide scalable cloud computing services. Rapid elasticity is very critical to meet the fluctuating demands of cloud users. The downside of rapid elasticity implementations is that they can cause significant loading of the system due to the high resource number of allocation and deallocation requests. Resource pooling refers to the concept that allows a virtual environment to allocate memory and processing capacity for a VMs use. On-demand refers to the fact that a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. Metered services are pre-paid, a-la-carte, pay-per-use, or committed offerings. A metered service like a database may charge its users based on the actual usage of the service resources on an hourly or monthly basis. For example, Dion Training used the AWS Lambda serverless product in some of our automation. This service charges us $0.20 for every 1 million requests processed."

    "explanation": "Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. It allows a company to pay a monthly or yearly fee to receive access to the software without managing the software locally within their own network. For example, many small businesses use Shopify to create an online e-commerce store that is classified as a SaaS product. Other examples include G Suite, Office 365, or Adobe Creative Cloud. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables consumers to rent fully configured systems that are set up for specific purposes. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables a consumer to outsource computing equipment purchases and running their own data center. Desktop as a Service (DaaS) provides a full virtualized desktop environment from within a cloud-based service.

    "correct_answer": [
      "On-demand"
    ],
    "explanation": "On-demand refers to the fact that a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. In this question, the cloud storage is provisioned and deprovisioned automatically for the user, and thereby it would be categorized as on-demand. Resource pooling refers to the concept that allows a virtual environment to allocate memory and processing capacity for a VMs use. Using a synchronization app can allow the files to be stored on both the laptop and the cloud service while maintaining the latest versions in both places. This allows a user to synchronize content between all of their own devices as well as share their cloud storage content with other users. Multiple users can simultaneously access the content to work collaboratively, or they can access it at different times. Each user's changes are typically marked with a flag or color highlighting to indicate who made changes to what content. Shared resources are any resources shared by multiple users or systems within an internal or cloud-based network."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Increase the contrast on the projector"
    ],
    "explanation": "If the image being displayed is dim, this could be an issue with your project's contrast. By increasing the contrast, you can increase the amount of light reflected from an all white image and an all black image. The higher the contrast ratio, the brighter the whites will appear in the image. For example, if you have a projector with a 3000:1 contrast ratio, this means that the white image is 3000 times brighter than the black image. The higher the contrast ratio, the more detail you can see on the projected image, regardless of whether it is numbers, pictures, graphs, text, or video. Contrast is what makes it possible for us to see the subtle shades of colors. If the project supports the contrast or contrast ratio adjustment, you should increase the contrast to brighten the screen's image."

    "explanation": "The digitizer is a touch-sensitive glass panel covering the LCD in a touchscreen assembly. The digitizer is used to convert touch events to digital signals that can be interpreted as different types of input. The digitizer can be touched and inspected without taking apart the device. Analog signals are created when you tap or swipe the surface of the display. The digitizer is connected to the laptop with a flexible digitizer cable. A grid of sensors is activated when you tap or swipe the screen. The sensors' information is sent through the digitizer cable to a circuit that converts the analog signal to a digital signal using binary. A backlight is a fluorescent lamp used to illuminate the image on a flat panel (LCD) screen. If the backlight or inverter fails, the screen image will go very, very dark. The inverter (also known as inverter board, screen inverter, or LCD inverter) is a part of the laptop's display assembly. The inverter is a small green board attached to the base of the LCD panel. In a laptop computer, the LCD screen relies on a backlight source to uniformly light up the screen, and the inverter acts as the power supply for this lighting source. If the inverter is faulty, the display will be too dim to easily see without an external light source like a flashlight. A capacitor is an electrical component that stores electrical energy and is often used to regulate voltages. It can hold a charge after the power is removed."

To configure DKIM, the organization uploads a public key as a TXT record in the DNS server. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) uses a DNS record published by an organization hosting an email service. The SPF record identifies the hosts authorized to send emails from that domain, and there must be only one per domain. SPF does not provide a cryptographic authentication mechanism like DKIM does, though. The Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) framework can ensure that SPF and DKIM are being utilized effectively. DMARC relies on DKIM for the cryptographic authentication mechanism, making it the incorrect option for this question. The simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission, which does not utilize cryptographic authentication mechanisms by default."

    "question": "Dion Training's file server uses a RAID 5 for its main data store. Recently, the RAID began flashing from green to yellow. Additionally, an alert was received that stated, \"RAID ARRAY DISK1 FAILURE\". Unfortunately, the company no longer has any spare 1 TB, 5400 RPM Seagate drives, so a technician replaces DISK1 with a 1 TB, 7200 RPM Western Digital drive. When the technician attempts to rebuild the array, the drive stays in degraded operation and continues to alert that \"RAID ARRAY DISK1 FAILURE\" is occurring. What is the most likely cause of this issue?",
    "options": [
      "Bad SATA cable",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "The HDD is incompatible"
    ],
    "explanation": "In this scenario, likely, the replacement HDD may not be compatible with the RAID. This will cause the RAID to stay degraded and the alert to continue to display. Whenever you need to replace a disk in a RAID, it is considered a best practice to replace it with the same brand and model of the hard drive. For this reason, most professionals purchase spare hard drives when initially building out their RAID array."

For the exam, if you are ever asked about installing memory in a small form factor device or a laptop, the answer will usually be SODIMM. Single-channel memory is any memory using one 64-bit bus between the CPU and the RAM. Error checking and correcting or error correcting code (ECC) is a type of system memory that has built-in error correction security. ECC is more expensive than normal memory and requires support from the motherboard. ECC is commonly used in production servers and not in standard desktops or laptops. Double data rate synchronous dynamic (DDR) random access memory is a standard for SDRAM where data is transferred twice per clock cycle to achieve a maximum data rate that is 64 times the bus speed in bps. There are various versions of DDR including DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5."

SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located in the service provider's data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, it will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables consumers to rent fully configured systems that are set up for specific purposes. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service that enables a consumer to outsource computing equipment purchases and running their own data center. Desktop as a Service (DaaS) provides a full virtualized desktop environment from within a cloud-based service. This is also known as VDI (Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure) and is coming in large enterprise businesses focused on increasing their security and minimizing their operational expenses."

    "explanation": "Multifactor authentication is an authentication scheme that relies on at least two of the five factors: something you know, something you have, something you are, something you do, and somewhere you are. Since the user must enter their username and password, this is something they know. Since the user must enter a one-time code texted to their smartphone, this is something they have. Using this combination is considered two-factor (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA). Single Sign-on (SSO) is an authentication technology that allows users to authenticate once and receive authorizations for multiple services. The advantage of single sign-on is that each user does not have to manage multiple user accounts and passwords. The disadvantage is that compromising the account also compromises multiple services. Face ID is an Apple device feature that uses a face lock to grant access to the device. Face ID is considered a form of biometric authentication. Touch ID is an Apple device feature that uses fingerprint biometric information to grant access to the device."

    "explanation": "The primary consideration for the storage controller card is that it supports hot-swappable drives. Being hot-swappable means that a bad HDD can be removed and replaced while the server runs, which prevents downtime. Data loss can be prevented by configuring a RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, or RAID 10, and the RAID can automatically replicate the data to the new hard drive that is replaced during the hot swapping process without any downtime or data loss. While the other options may be good features to have, the most important feature is support for hot-swapping to minimize downtime."

    "explanation": "The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a protocol in the TCP/IP suite that operates at the transport layer to provide connection-oriented, guaranteed delivery of packets. Hosts must first establish a session to exchange data and then confirm the delivery of packets using acknowledgments when using TCP. TCP is relatively slow in comparison to UDP. Secure shell (SSH) is the protocol used for remote administration and file copying using TCP port 22. SSH is considered secure since it uses authenticated and encrypted sessions for communication. The trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP) is a protocol used to get a file from a remote host or put a file onto a remote host. TFTP is commonly used with embedded devices or systems that retrieve firmware, configuration information, or a system image during the boot process. TFTP operates over UDP port 69. The simple network management protocol (SNMP) is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices over UDP ports 161 and 162. A management system collates data sent by agents running on each device. The agents maintain a Management Information Base of configuration and usage data. An agent can also generate a trap, alerting the management system of some notable event (such as a printer that is out of paper). The dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to allocate IP addresses to a host when it joins a network. DHCP utilizes UDP ports 67 and 68."

A metered service like a database may charge its users based on the actual usage of the service resources on an hourly or monthly basis. For example, Dion Training used the AWS Lambda serverless product in some of our automation. This service charges us $0.20 for every 1 million requests processed. Resource pooling refers to the concept that allows a virtual environment to allocate memory and processing capacity for a VMs use. Rapid elasticity is used to describe scalable provisioning or the capability to provide scalable cloud computing services. Rapid elasticity is very critical to meet the fluctuating demands of cloud users. The downside of rapid elasticity implementations is that they can cause significant loading of the system due to the high resource number of allocation and deallocation requests. Measured service is a term that IT professionals apply to cloud computing that references services where the cloud provider measures or monitors the provision of services for various reasons, including billing, effective use of resources, or overall predictive planning."

    "explanation": "A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. \"Fiber to the X\" (FTTx) is commonly used to describe where the fiber connection ends between the service and the subscriber. The closer the fiber is to the user's network, the faster the service. FTTH (fiber to the house) provides fiber directly to the user's home network making it the fastest option. Traditionally, you will find a 1 Gbps connection or higher with FTTH. FTTN (fiber to the node) or FTTC (fiber to the curb/cabinet) provides fiber only to the local area or neighborhood but then uses copper cabling from the node/cabinet/curb to the home network, which slows down the network (generally, 100-200 Mbps). Satellite systems provide far bigger areas of coverage than can be achieved using other technologies. A Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) microwave antenna is aligned to an orbital satellite that can either relay signals between sites directly or via another satellite. DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection)."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Purchase and use a USB to RJ-45 adapter"
    ],
    "explanation": "Since the RJ-45 port on the laptop is most likely an integrated port on the motherboard, you will have to wait for the manufacturer to replace the motherboard for you. To get back onto the wired network at the office the quickest, you should purchase an external (USB) wired network adapter. These usually are small devices that will allow you to plug a wired network cable with an RJ-45 connector into the external adapter and connect it to the laptop using a USB port. This works just like the integrated RJ-45 adapter but can be installed in just a few seconds. Alternatively, you could use a port replicator or docking station if there was one available at the office. NIC teaming allows the grouping of multiple physical Ethernet network adapters into one or more software-based virtual network adapters for increased performance or fault tolerance. This would require multiple physical network interface cards to be installed in your laptop already, which is not the case in this scenario. Replacing the motherboard would work if you had one available, but the process can be time-consuming. It would be quicker and easier to simply use an external (USB) wired network interface adapter, instead. Airplane mode and 802.11ac adapters are used with wireless networks, therefore it cannot solve this issue since the office building does not have a wireless network available."

    "explanation": "A distended capacitor would require the replacement of the motherboard. The incorrect date/time on the workstation is indicative of a dead CMOS battery. A burning smell most likely indicates a bad power supply. A variety of hardware failure or system instability can cause the computer to reboot continuously, but this doesn't make replacing the motherboard the most likely solution."

    "explanation": "The private cloud meets the store chain's two major requirements because it gives organizations greater control over the privacy and security of its data stored in the cloud. The public cloud is incorrect because there are risks regarding performance and security. The public cloud is a shared resource with other organizations, and a cloud service provider (CSP) runs it. A hybrid cloud is incorrect because some cloud functions can be done via a public cloud, creating potential vulnerabilities to privacy and security.

PaaS would provide IT hardware and the database platform on top of the hardware, but the customer must develop their app to run on top of the platform. The service provider will maintain the integrity and the availability of the platform for the customer. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is incorrect because it will only provide IT hardware management for the customer.

A redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is an array that appears as a single storage resource or volume and can be partitioned and formatted like any other drive. A hard disk drive (HDD) stores data on metal or glass platters coated with a magnetic substance. The top and bottom of each platter are accessed by its own read/write head, moved by an actuator mechanism. The M.2 adapter card form factor is considerably smaller than a PCIe adapter and is oriented horizontally rather than vertically, so the interface is often used on laptops and PC motherboards."

Vertical or horizontal line marks that appear in the same place are often due to dirty feed rollers or a damaged or dirty photosensitive drum. Toner not fused to paper has symptoms of output that smudges easily. This indicates that the fuser needs replacing.

    "correct_answer": [
      "POP3",
      "IMAP"
    ],
    "explanation": "The Post Office Protocol (POP) is an early example of a mailbox access protocol. POP is often referred to as POP3 because the active version of the protocol is version 3. The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail retrieval protocol. Still, its mailbox management features support permanent connections to a server and connect multiple clients to the same mailbox simultaneously. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) allows clients to upload and download files from a network server. It uploads files to websites. Domain Name System (DNS) allows clients to request resources using plain names rather than IP addresses."

    "explanation": "A hard disk drive (HDD) has moving pieces that generally make a low-level sound when accessed. A loud or grinding noise, or any clicking sound, is a sign of a mechanical problem. The error message \"Bootable device not found\" could indicate a physical problem, but it is just as likely to be a corrupted boot disk sector (software problem). Bad sectors in an HDD typically cause read/write failures when trying to open or save a file. Power failures or mechanical faults can cause read/write failures. No light-emitting diode (LED) status indicators can mean the whole system is not receiving power or an individual disk unit is faulty."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "IPS"

    "explanation": "In-plane switching (IPS) uses crystals that rotate rather than twist. The main benefit is to deliver better color reproduction at a wider range of viewing angles. Most IPS panels support 178/178 degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles. Vertical alignment (VA) uses crystals that tilt rather than twist or rotate. This technology supports a wide color gamut and the best contrast-ratio performance. An array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can provide illumination in a flat panel. Most smartphone and tablet screens use edge lighting where the LEDs are at the top or bottom of the screen. A separate LED generates each pixel in an organic LED (OLED) display, or technically, an advanced matrix OLED (AMOLED) display."

    "explanation": "If the redundant array of independent disks (RAID) array cannot boot, the first step is to use the configuration utility to verify the status. If the system cannot reach it, then the controller likely failed. Single disk failure would not stop the booting process from happening. RAID arrays operate so that a single disk can fail and not cause any data loss. Misconfiguration can always be a problem, but no recent changes occurred in this case. If it was booting fine before and no configurations have changed, then misconfiguration is highly unlikely to be the problem. A failed real-time clock (RTC) battery will cause an incorrect date or time but will not stop a RAID array from booting."

There could be a termination or external interference problem. An advanced type of cable tester called a \"certifier\" can report detailed information about cable performance and interference. VoIP call quality can only really be established by using a quality of service (QoS) mechanism across the network.

Typically, each PSU plugs into a backplane on a server and is hot-swappable. A modular power supply has power connector cables that are detachable from the unit. A liquid-based cooling system refers to a system of pumping water around the chassis. Water is a more effective coolant than air convection, and a good pump can run more quietly than numerous fans. An open-loop system will usually need draining, cleaning, and refilling periodically. The fans and radiators need to be kept dust-free.

    "explanation": "The paper passes through the fuser assembly after passing through the transfer assembly. The fuser unit squeezes the paper between a hot roller and a pressure roller so that the toner melts onto the paper's surface. The transfer roller applies a positive charge to the underside of the paper. This causes the toner on the drum to be attracted to the paper. This prevents the paper from sticking to the drum or curling as it enters the fuser unit. The pickup roller turns against the paper stack, pushing the paper into a feed and separation roller assembly. The developer roller is a magnetized roller located very close to the photosensitive drum."

To solve this, they should extend the scope or shorten the lease time to allow for more address availability. If users can see and authenticate to the wireless network, access to a virtual LAN (VLAN) is not the problem. The devices can communicate enough to authenticate.

    "explanation": "A touch screen can also be referred to as a digitizer due to the way it converts analog touch input to digital software instructions. The digitizer is sandwiched between a layer of protective glass and the display panel. A display panel is only a single layer within the screen assembly for a mobile device. A display sits below the digitizer. Protective glass covers the digitizer on a mobile device. The protective glass and digitizer usually adhere together. The touchscreen itself is covered by a thin layer of scratch-resistant, shock-resistant tempered glass, such as Corning's Gorilla Glass."

Redirecting the heater should resolve the problem. Intermittent shutdowns can be an indicator of malware, but the physical details in this example do not point to malware as the problem. A power supply unit (PSU) that is not delivering stable power can cause intermittent shutdowns, but this does not seem to be the problem here. Instead, the space heater is the apparent problem. Hard drive failure can result in intermittent shutdowns and is diagnosed with OS tools, such as the chkdsk command. However, this is unlikely to be the problem in this case."

A community cloud allows several organizations to share the costs of either a hosted private or fully private cloud by pooling resources for common concerns, such as standardization and security policies. Private cloud is incorrect because it does not allow for sharing cloud resources with organizations. Hybrid cloud deployment is not the best choice for the CSP's new customers because the customers want to share resources full-time. The public cloud is incorrect because the CSP's customers still want a private cloud to share with organizations with the same security concerns."

    "explanation": "Every NIC port has a unique hardware/physical address called the media access control (MAC) address. Each frame of Ethernet data identifies the source MAC address and destination MAC address in a header field. The core protocol in TCP/IP is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides network and host addressing and packet forwarding between networks. This is not specific to the hardware. A service set identifier (SSID) is a character string that identifies a particular wireless LAN (WLAN). VLAN IDs are on network switch ports for traffic management and network segmentation. These are assigned by software and not native to the hardware."

The power output is not the same as the PSU's power from grid power. A redundant power supply requires a compatible motherboard. This configuration is more common in server systems than on desktop PCs. Typically, each PSU plugs into a backplane on a server and is hot-swappable. A modular power supply has power connector cables that are detachable from the unit. A heat sink is a block of copper aluminum with fins. The fins expose a larger surface area to the air around the component to achieve a cooling effect by convection."

Using the wrong adapter can cause problems, such as the battery not completely charging. As batteries age, they no longer hold a charge and need to be replaced. This would be the best answer, except that the boot error points to another problem. A swollen battery indicates a problem with the battery's charging circuit.

The technician should first check that the system has initialized and formatted with a partition structure and file system. If the system does not detect the disk by a configuration tool, such as Windows Disk Management, the technician will suspect that there is a hardware or cable/connector fault. The computer booted up correctly, so a corrupted boot sector is not the problem. Overheating is generally detected by the computer becoming hot to the touch.

Quality of Service (QoS) means using a network protocol to prioritize certain traffic types over others. Enterprise networks can use QoS protocols to make sure traffic such as Voice over IP calling or video conferencing is given higher priority than traffic where packets' timing is less important, such as ordinary file downloads. MAC Filtering refers to a security access control method whereby the MAC address assigned to each network card is used to determine access to the network. The dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to allocate IP addresses to a host when it joins a network. DHCP utilizes UDP ports 67 and 68.

      "Signal attenuation"
    ],
    "explanation": "The most likely reason is signal attenuation from the new flag being placed between the signal path which may be obstructing the line-of-sight between the antennas. Based on where the flag is precisely located, it is possible to only block the signal when the wind is blowing in a certain direction. This would lead to the intermittent connectivity experienced by the users caused by the signal attenuation when the flag is blocking the communication path between the antennas. DHCP exhaustion occurs when the DHCP server runs out of available IP addresses and stops issuing DHCP bindings. If DHCP exhaustion occurred, the users would not have received an IP address and they would have no connectivity instead of intermittent connectivity. The question does not mention anything about the antennas being moved or replaced recently, so it is unlikely to be an issue with the antennas since they worked previously with the same wireless network and distanced. Bandwidth saturation occurs if too many devices are on one WAN link, but nothing in the question indicates that more users have been added and causing an issue."

      "Test the power supply"
    ],
    "explanation": "A computer that keeps rebooting itself is a symptom of a faulty power supply or a computer that is overheating. If the power supply is faulty, the computer will reboot itself. If the issue is caused by an overheating issue (such as a cooling fan failure), the computer will usually reboot itself after running for 15-20 minutes (once enough heat is built-up). Therefore, you should test the power supply first to determine if that is the root cause of the issue, and then replace the power supply, if required."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Calibrate the monitor and printer to use the same color profile"

    "explanation": "Incorrect chroma display occurs when the printer and the monitor are using different color profiles. To fix this issue, it is important to calibrate both the printer and the monitor to the same standard so that the colors will match. Changing the color to a sepia tone would make the printout appear brown which would not solve this issue. Replacing the toner would help if the printout is faded, but that is not occurring in this scenario. The print drivers would not cause the color to be incorrect, only the incorrect chroma settings and calibration would."

    "explanation": "A Bluetooth card reader can be used to capture the purchaser's credit card details. These Bluetooth card readers may support magnetic card reading capabilities (swiping a card), smart chip reading capabilities (chip and pin), or even NFC reading capabilities (Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.). For example, in the United States, Square's mobile payment terminal is popular for small businesses and entrepreneurs. By capturing the credit card details electronically (instead of just typing them in), the merchant pays a lower payment processing fee and saves on credit card fees charged when a customer makes a purchase. DB-9 is a type of serial port connector used on legacy desktops and laptops. Infrared (IR) was a wireless networking standard supporting speeds up to about 4 Mbps with a direct line of sight for communications. Infrared sensors are used in mobile devices and with IR blasters to control appliances. While infrared (IR) used to be commonly used to connect wireless mice and keyboards to a laptop in the 1990s, it has fallen out of favor in the last 10-15 years since Bluetooth is more reliable and does not require a direct line of sight between the device and the laptop. A memory card reader is a device containing one or more slots to accommodate reading (and writing) memory cards. A memory card is a flash drive typically used for digital cameras and smartphones."

A dedicated GPU also can be upgraded with a newer graphics card in the future to increase performance. An integrated video card is built as part of the main system motherboard or CPU. An integrated GPU is cheaper than a dedicated GPU, but it has limited performance and shares the use of the computer system's RAM. An integrated video card cannot be upgraded since it is part of the processor or motherboard.

But, if Tony neglected to add the proper permissions to John's account, then John would be unable to print. This is indicated by the access denied error message received when he attempts to print a document. The printer is not offline since it is powered on and properly connected to the workstation. The print spooler is not hung as evidenced by the system administrator can print to it. Memory limitations can be a factor, but that produces a different error message."

A burning smell emitting from your laptop indicates that your machine's cooling system is not functioning properly. If your laptop smells like something is burning, this usually means that your computer is overheating. This can be caused by a fan not working properly. For example, if the power supply unit's fan isn't working properly, the unit can overheat, and the wiring in the power supply's transformer can start to burn or melt.

Software-defined networking (SDN) uses Application Programming Interfaces (API) and compatible hardware that allows for the programming of network appliances and systems. A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection). An optical network terminal (ONT) is a device that connects fiber optics cables to other types of wiring such as Ethernet and phone lines by converting the signal from optical to electrical and vice versa. An ONT is commonly used with fiber to the house (FTTH) installations."

A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a logically separate network that is created using switching technology. Even though hosts on two VLANs may be physically connected to the same cabling, local traffic is isolated to each VLAN so they must use a router to communicate. A hub provides no intelligence in its interconnection functions so that whatever is received on one port is repeated out every other port. A wireless access point (WAP), or access point, connects directly to a wired local area network and the AP then provides wireless connections using Wi-Fi for other devices to use that wired connection. An unmanaged switch operates out-of-the-box without any setup or configuration by switching network traffic based on MAC addresses and putting each switch port into its own collision domain.

A RAID 5 provides block-level striping with distributed parity to provide redundancy using a minimum of three disks. A RAID 10 combines disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data stored in the array and required a minimum of four disks. A RAID 5 requires at least three hard drives to operate, and a RAID 10 requires at least four hard drives to operate; therefore, neither is an acceptable solution to this problem."

    "options": [
      "PCIe",
      "AGP",
      "PCI",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "PCIe"
    ],
    "explanation": "PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) uses lanes between any two intercommunicating devices. This utilizes a separated pair of wires for both directions of traffic. This increases the bus lanes' speed since there is no possibility of collisions or waiting for other devices to finish communicating. PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) is an interface standard for connecting high-speed components. Every desktop PC motherboard has some PCIe slots you can use to add GPUs (video cards or graphics cards), RAID cards, network adapters, Wi-Fi cards, or SSD (solid-state drive) add-on cards. The types of PCIe slots available in your PC will depend on your motherboard and are designated as PCIe x1, x4, x8, and x16. Graphics cards almost exclusively rely on PCIe x16 expansion slots for their connectivity. AGP, PCI, and PCI-X are older technologies that rely on shared busses for communication."

      "Hotspot"
    ],
    "explanation": "A portable hotspot is a dedicated mobile device that connects to a cellular network and provides a wireless (Wi-Fi) network for a small number of users. Most smartphones can conduct wireless tethering as a form of creating a hotspot. Tethering uses the cellular data plan of a mobile device to provide Internet access to a laptop or PC. The PC can be tethered to the mobile by USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi (a mobile hotspot). One method of doing this is to connect the laptop to the device using a Wi-Fi connection and routing all of your data from your laptop to the phone over Wi-Fi and then from the phone to the Internet using the phone's built-in cellular modem. A tunneling (or encapsulation) protocol wraps up data from one protocol for transfer over a different type of network. For example, PPP can carry TCP/IP data over a dial-up line, enabling a remote computer to communicate with the LAN. A baseband update is the modification of the firmware of a cellular modem."

    "correct_answer": [
      "POP3"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should configure POP3 because the mail is downloaded to the device and removes mail from the server's mailbox by default. IMAP does not remove the mail from the server when the client connects but instead maintains a copy on the server indefinitely until the user forces it to be deleted. SMTP is used to send emails, not receive them. HTTPS is used for web browsing, not for receiving emails. The post office protocol (POP3) is a TCP/IP application protocol providing a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server over port 110. The server usually deletes messages once the client has downloaded them. The internet message access protocol (IMAP) is a TCP/IP application protocol that provides a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server using TCP port number 143. Unlike POP3, messages persist on the server after the client has downloaded them. IMAP also supports mailbox management functions, such as creating subfolders and access to the same mailbox by more than one client at the same time. The simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) is the protocol used to send mail between hosts on the Internet using TCP port 25. The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a secure protocol used to provide web content to browsers using SSL/TLS encryption over port 443."

    "explanation": "IP addresses are either public, private, localhost, or APIPA addresses. Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform that function. When a host uses an APIPA address, it can communicate with other hosts on the same network using APIPA. Still, it cannot reach other networks or communicate with hosts who have managed to obtain a valid DHCP lease. Any address from 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255 is considered an APIPA address. An APIPA address is also referred to as a link-local address. A private IP address is in the range of 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, or 192.168.x.x. A localhost IP is 127.0.0.1.

    "explanation": "A network interface card is an expansion card that enables a PC to connect to a LAN. Network interface cards are also referred to as network adapters. A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection). An optical network terminal (ONT) is a device that connects fiber optics cables to other types of wiring such as Ethernet and phone lines by converting the signal from optical to electrical and vice versa. An ONT is commonly used with fiber to the house (FTTH) installations."

    "explanation": "Load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources to make their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle. Traffic shaping, also known as packet shaping, is the manipulation and prioritization of network traffic to reduce the impact of heavy users or machines from affecting other users. Traffic shaping is used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of packets by delaying other kinds. High availability (HA) is a component of a technology system that eliminates single points of failure to ensure continuous operations or uptime for an extended period. Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail."

    "explanation": "For optimal network performance, the placement of the Wireless Access Point (WAP) guidelines should be taken into consideration to ensure that the building's construction doesn't cause interference with the wireless signals. To determine if adequate coverage and signal strength is being received in the building, you can conduct a wireless site survey. The service set identifier (SSID) is a group of wireless network devices which share a common natural language label, such as a network name. The SSID would not affect the devices and cause sporadic connection drops. Bandwidth saturation is a phenomenon that occurs when all of a circuit's available bandwidth in a given direction is being utilized by a large upload or download which can result in high latency and performance issues. Bandwidth saturation would not cause the wireless connection to drop, though. Encryption type refers to the type of security used on a wireless network, such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3.

You can do this either by rewiring the jack or twisting the relevant pairs together on a cable stub. Alternatively, you can purchase a prefabricated loopback plug. When you connect a loopback plug to a port, you should see a solid connection LED. You can also use the loopback plug in conjunction with diagnostic software. A crimper is a tool used to attach an RJ-45 plastic connector to an unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or shielded twisted pair (STP) cable. It pushes a portion of the plastic into the jacket of the cable to hold it in place. A cable tester is used to ensure a cable is properly created as a patch cable (straight through) or a crossover cable. Cable testers provide detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of the cable. For example, they test and report cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, and other cable run characteristics. Punchdown tools are used to connect an ethernet cable to the back of a patch panel, a punchdown block, or the back of a network wall jack."

    "question": "You are traveling to Thailand on a business trip. Your laptop's touchscreen display is visibly flickering between being too bright and too dim when plugged into the power outlet at a local coffee shop. You take your laptop to your hotel room, and you notice it doesn't flicker when plugged in there. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?",
    "options": [
      "The inverter of the laptop is faulty",
      "The digitizer of the laptop is faulty",
      "The coffee shop was experiencing power fluctuations that led to the flickering of the display",
      "The battery of the laptop is failing to charge"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "The coffee shop was experiencing power fluctuations that led to the flickering of the display"
    ],
    "explanation": "Since the only change between the flickering and non-flickering was the change in location and the power source, it is likely the cause of the issue. In some areas of the world, power is less stable and reliable than in more industrialized countries like the United States, Canada, England, and Japan. Some locations around the world have less reliable power that is subject to more power fluctuations. Flicker is a visible change in a lamp's brightness due to rapid fluctuations in the power supply voltage. The voltage drop is generated over the grid's source impedance by the changing load current of equipment or facility. These fluctuations can generate the visible flicker noticed by the user of the device."

    "explanation": "A modular power supply will allow the user to attach or detach cables to the power supply as needed. This helps reduce the cable clutter inside of the case and increases airflow for cooling. A redundant power supply is when a single piece of computer equipment operates using two or more physical power supplies. Each of the power supplies will have the capacity to run the device on its own, which will allow it to operate even if one goes down. A 750-watt power supply is commonly used in gaming computers since they have high-powered graphics cards. A dual voltage power supply allows the power supply to use either 115 VAC or 230 VAC as its input."

Previously, the library only had a small wired network that relied on statically assigned IP addresses. You just finished installing all of the wireless access points. You configured a server to automatically provide an IP address to wireless clients when connecting to one of the wireless access points. To test the new wireless network, you turn on your wireless adapter on your laptop and connect to the network. Your laptop is automatically assigned an IP address of 192.168.1.12 from the DHCP server, and you can ping the default gateway of 192.168.1.1. You open a web browser and attempt to connect to diontraining.com, but you cannot connect and instead receive an error.

    "explanation": "Since you are already connected to the wireless network and can ping the gateway using its IP address, you already know the SSID and DHCP are properly configured (therefore, you should not select these options). It is a poor security practice to disable the firewall, so it is not recommended that you choose this option. Since we cannot access a website using its domain name (diontraining.com), we can successfully ping a remote server using its IP address (8.8.8.8). This indicates that your laptop has not been properly assigned a DNS server to use by the DHCP server. Therefore, you need to verify the DHCP server is properly configured to provide the IP address of a DNS server to the clients when it assigned them their IP address configuration information."

    "explanation": "The remote desktop protocol (RDP) is a protocol used for the remote administration of a host using a graphical user interface. RDP operates over TCP port 3389. Secure shell (SSH) is the protocol used for remote administration and file copying using TCP port 22. SSH is considered secure since it uses authenticated and encrypted sessions for communication. Telnet is the protocol used for remote command-line administration of a host using TCP port 23. Telnet is considered insecure since it is unauthenticated and unencrypted. The post office protocol (POP3) is a TCP/IP application protocol providing a means for a client to access email messages stored in a mailbox on a remote server over port 110. The server usually deletes messages once the client has downloaded them."

    "options": [
      "Router",
      "Access point",
      "Managed switch",
      "Hub"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Router"
    ],
    "explanation": "A router is a network device that links dissimilar networks and can support multiple alternate paths between locations based upon the parameters of speed, traffic loads, and cost. Routers are used to logically divide networks into subnets. A hub provides no intelligence in its interconnection functions so that whatever is received on one port is repeated out every other port. This leads to many collisions occurring on the hub and increases the number of rebroadcasts which slows down the entire network. A wireless access point (WAP), or access point, connects directly to a wired local area network and the AP then provides wireless connections using Wi-Fi for other devices to use that wired connection. An AP supports the connection of multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection. A switch is a network device that receives incoming data into a buffer, then the destination MAC address is compared with an address table so that data is only sent out to the port with the corresponding MAC address. In a switched network, each port is in a separate collision domain. A managed switch is a switch with advanced networking functions and security settings that can be enabled and configured by an administrator."

    ],
    "explanation": "It is relatively common for the DC jack to fail over time. The DC jack can become loose over time, or the jack itself can become separated from the motherboard. Replacing a DC jack requires disassembling the laptop, de-soldering and removing the old jack, then soldering the new jack into place. Most laptop DC jacks are specific to the manufacturer and the laptop model. Cellular cards are usually installed in a Mini PCIe expansion card slot and are not soldered to the motherboard. The screen and the battery are not soldered in most laptops and can be replaced by removing and replacing screws. Some manufacturers have begun soldering screens and batteries in some of their models, but this is still not considered common practice. A DC jack is always solder to the motherboard in a laptop, therefore it is the best answer to this question."

    "correct_answer": [
      "The broadcast is disabled on the wireless router"

    "explanation": "If the SSID (Secure Set Identifier) is disabled, then the wireless network name will not be broadcast to any available devices within range. Both Wireless B and G use the same frequency band (2.4 GHz) and would not cause this issue. Similarly, encryption that is enabled or disabled would not affect the SSID broadcast since the SSID is sent out in cleartext. DHCP support is used once a device connects to the network. Therefore it would not affect the SSID broadcast."

    "explanation": "Most wearable fitness devices come with a 3-axis accelerometer to track movement in every direction. Some more advanced trackers will also use a gyroscope to measure the orientation and rotation of the device. However, the accelerometer is still the crucial component to measure the activity of the user. The data collected is then converted into steps and activity and from then into calories and sleep quality. Near field communications (NFC) is a standard for peer-to-peer (2-way) radio communications over very short (around 4\") distances that facilitate contactless payment and similar technologies. The inverter (also known as inverter board, screen inverter, or LCD inverter) is a part of the laptop's display assembly. The inverter is a small green board attached to the base of the LCD panel. In a laptop computer, the LCD screen relies on a backlight source to uniformly light up the screen, and the inverter acts as the power supply for this lighting source. If the inverter is faulty, the display will be too dim to easily see without an external light source like a flashlight. The digitizer is a touch-sensitive glass panel covering the LCD in a touchscreen assembly. The digitizer is used to convert touch events to digital signals that can be interpreted as different types of input. The digitizer can be touched and inspected without taking apart the device."

    "explanation": "Most monitors have a default or native resolution. When you first connect a monitor to a Windows workstation, this native resolution is detected, and Windows attempts to configure itself automatically. If this creates an imbalance between the two monitors, a technician can adjust the screen's resolution by changing it in the Display settings area of Windows 10. Color depth defines how many unique colors can be displayed by the projected image at once. Refresh rate is the measure of how fast an image can be updated on a monitor or display. If a monitor has a lower refresh rate, then blurring and ghosting can occur. The extended mode allows the Windows output to be stretched across two or more monitors as if they were a single monitor. This can be configured under the Display settings in Windows 10."

If someone is installing or replacing a graphics card, it is important to compare the current system's power usage to the wattage rating of the power supply to ensure it can support the new graphics card. SATA connectors are not used with graphics cards but are instead used for storage devices and optical drives. The power supply should support 115 VAC or 230 VAC as its input and provide 12 VDC, 5 VDC, and 3.3 VDC as its output.

It is dark inside an electrophotographic (EP) printer, except when the laser scanning assembly shines on particular areas of the photosensitive drum, reducing the high negative charge to a much lower negative charge. Toner itself is negatively charged and repelled by the highly negative charged areas but attracted to the areas with a very low charge. The use of varying negative charges is what facilitates the printing process. When replacing a photosensitive drum, it's best to avoid exposing it to light."

    "question": "Your friend wants to run cable for a PoE WAP in their workshop, which is about 100 feet from the network connection in their house. They're not sure how to go about it, but they know that they don't want to have wires overhead. They also want to make sure it is shielded. What type of cable can you suggest that can go that far and has superior insulation and a water blocking layer?",

    "correct_answer": [
      "UTP is more flexible.",
      "UTP is less expensive."
    ],
    "explanation": "Shielded twisted pair (STP) has at least one extra layer of shielding to protect the cable from crosstalk and interference. Some types of STP have shielding around each wire. With all the extra material, STP tends to be less flexible and more expensive than unshielded twisted pair (UTP). Being shielded or unshielded doesn't affect the maximum transmission speed of a cable, and UTP is not suitable for direct burial."

      "IDE",
      "eSATA"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "IDE"
    ],
    "explanation": "Integrated Device Electronics (IDE) cables were used to connect parallel ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) drives to a motherboard. PATA cables had 40 connector pins and could connect two hard drives per cable. Most motherboards at the time had two IDE connectors, so they were capable of connecting four IDE hard drives. PATA were replaced by serial ATA (SATA) drives and cables, which are much faster and only connect one drive per cable, simplifying installation. Several SATA connectors can be on a single motherboard. IDE and ATA are often used interchangeably, although they aren't exactly the same. IDE was the parallel interface that used an ATA protocol. SATA is a serial, as opposed to a parallel, ATA connection. A UPS is an uninterruptible power supply, and eSATA is external SATA."

Virtual memory works by moving a chunk of information, called a page, to a file named pagefile.sys. pagefile.sys is literally the file on the hard drive where information in virtual memory is stored. Because of this, virtual memory is sometimes called the page file or paging file. It isn't as fast to access as actual RAM, but it will allow some programs to run that wouldn't otherwise.

    "explanation": "Adding case fans can draw excess heat out of a case, and cooler air into the case. Most processors won't shut down until they reach 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (158 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit), so if a person is working in that room, the ambient temperature won't be that high. Heat monitoring software lets you see what's going on but won't help cool the case. Removing the chassis cover subjects the computer to debris and dust that can cause other problems, and a refrigerator is likely to cause condensation, which can short out electrical systems.

The pattern of beeps has a specific meaning. Often continuous short beeps is a RAM problem, while one short beep and three long is video, but you would need to consult the motherboard manual to be sure.

    "explanation": "When files are written to a hard drive, they're not always written contiguously (with all of the data in a single location). As a result, file data is spread out over the disk, and the time it takes to retrieve files from the disk increases. Defragmenting a disk involves analyzing the disk and then consolidating fragmented files and folders so that they occupy a contiguous space, thus increasing performance during file retrieval."

    "explanation": "Corrosion can limit or totally prevent a phone's charger port and cable from making a connection, but you don't necessarily need to replace the port or the phone. Tread carefully when cleaning corrosion. Isopropyl alcohol is used to clean because it will dry very quickly. Ensure that the phone is powered off and remove the battery if it is one that is intended to be removed. Use as little liquid as possible on a lint-free cleaning swab, and be gentle. Never use a toothbrush to clean the phone's power port."

A wireless range extender might also do the trick. You wouldn't install wired connections for the users because not all visitors will have an RJ45 connection on their device or carry a cable with them.

There could also be a problem with connectivity with the mouse port. Try using a different port to see if the problem disappears."

The water-resistant feature fades over time and doesn't protect the phone against water under pressure (like a shower) or extreme temperatures. If your phone gets wet, immediately turn it off. Tap it gently with the power port facing down to remove excess water and leave it off in a well-ventilated area to allow it to dry out for several hours. A fan gently blowing cool air into the power connector may help. Wipe any visible water off the phone with a clean, soft cloth, but don't stick anything into the phone's ports.

If a cable moves along with the printhead, make sure that is it not caught on something or obstructed in some way. Check for any blockages or debris that may be preventing moving parts from moving. It those two things don't resolve the issue, refer to the manufacturer's documentation or online resources as there are many different kinds and manufacturers of 3D printers. 3D printers don't have ink ribbons, and you wouldn't replace the printhead (Nozzle Extruder Print Head) without further troubleshooting first."

Try using ink or toner made specifically for that make and model of printer. Another quick fix is to ensure that the printer is defaulting to better quality, not faster speed. The exact steps to do that depend on the specific printer being used.

A broken cleaning blade causes old toner to build up on the EP drum and consequently present itself in the next printed image. If the erasure lamps are bad, then the previous electrostatic discharges aren't completely wiped away. When the EP drum rotates toward the developing roller, some toner sticks to the slightly discharged areas. A third cause can be printing many copies of a document without allowing the printer to cool off between. In that case, the toner can stick onto the fusing roller."

A few different issues could cause this problem. First, ink could be bleeding from adjacent areas of the picture, causing the color to be off. A leaking cartridge can cause this, as can using the wrong type of paper for your printer. Paper that is designed for an ink-jet printer has different characteristics than paper designed for a laser printer.

    ],
    "explanation": "Although your spouse may want a better laptop, if it was working fine before and the only thing that has changed is router placement, that's most likely the problem. Large motors and microwaves, among other things, can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can wreak havoc with Wi-Fi signals.

    "options": [
      "On a stand in the corner of the dining room.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "On a stand in the corner of the dining room."
    ],
    "explanation": "Wi-Fi signals are radio waves and part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The metal staircase would act like an antenna, absorbing the energy of the signal. Sofas are thick and most have metal in them that will also absorb the signal. The sunny windowsill is out in the open, but sunlight can interfere with radio signals too, and too much heat might damage the router. The best option here is on the stand in the corner of the dining room, which is in the center of the home. While you have chairs and a table there, there would likely not be as much furniture to block the signal as behind the sofa. Placement would, of course, depend on the exact situation."

The DHCP server, not knowing that the address has been statically assigned somewhere, doles out the address, and now there's a conflict. Rebooting the computer won't help, and neither will releasing the address and getting a new lease from the DHCP server—it's just going to hand out the same address again because it doesn't know that there's a problem.

An oversaturated WAP would show sluggish performance and dropped packets. SSID broadcast shouldn't be the issue because they've connected to this network before and likely have saved the network to their device.

Mechanical drives often use revolutions per minute (RPM), which is also known as spindle speed, as an indication of how fast they can access data. Solid-state drives (SSDs) have no moving parts, so there is no spindle speed. Regardless of the drive type, IOPS is a better way to compare drive performance, and the only way when they are not the same type of drive.

    "explanation": "Biometric authentication uses biological data, like a fingerprint, for identification. Enabling the fingerprint scanner, a feature common on enterprise-grade laptops, provides a high level of security because fingerprints cannot be easily stolen or guessed like passwords. While disk encryption protects data, it isn't a biometric solution. An HSM stores cryptographic keys and is not the feature to enable for biometric login. NFC-based authentication requires a separate hardware key and is not a biometric method."

    "explanation": "A primary troubleshooting step is to check physical connections. The 24-pin connector is the main power connection from the PSU to the motherboard, and if it's not seated properly, the system won't receive power correctly. Verifying specific output voltages (which are typically 3.3V, 5V, and 12V, not 3.5V) is a more advanced step. The input voltage from the wall socket is much higher (100-220V AC), not 12V. 5-volt standby is a useful but not essential feature for basic function."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Bad fuser assembly"
    ],
    "explanation": "The fuser assembly is responsible for using heat and pressure to melt and permanently bond the toner to the paper. If the toner rubs off easily, it indicates the fuser is not getting hot enough to complete this process, and the assembly likely needs to be replaced. A bad transfer corona would likely result in a blank page, while damp paper or dust would cause other issues like paper jams or random white spots."

    "explanation": "A loud, periodic clicking sound is a classic symptom of a hard drive head crash, where the read/write heads are physically hitting the disk platters. This is a critical issue that signals imminent drive failure and potential data loss. The other options are unlikely to cause this specific sound. An overpowered fan would create a whirring or buzzing noise. An aggressively overclocked CPU might produce a popping sound and smoke if it burns out.

    "explanation": "The most likely cause is that the internal antenna wires were not connected to the wireless adapter during installation. Without the antenna, the adapter cannot detect wireless networks, even though it appears to be functioning correctly in Device Manager. Mini-PCI cards draw power from the slot and do not have separate power cables. An incorrect driver would likely cause an error in Device Manager, and a disabled adapter would prevent the Wi-Fi section from appearing in Networks at all."

    "explanation": "The technician should use the tracert command (or traceroute on UNIX/Linux). This utility traces the path that packets take to a destination, sending a message to each router (or \"hop\") along the way and reporting the results. This allows the technician to identify which router in the path is failing and causing the communication breakdown. Ping only tests end-to-end connectivity, netstat displays network statistics, and netdom is for Active Directory management."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Some devices on the laptop may not function."
    ],
    "explanation": "The most likely issue is that some devices on the new laptop may not function correctly. The Windows installation on the old SSD has drivers installed specifically for the desktop's hardware. When moved to the new laptop, which has different hardware, the existing drivers will not match, and any devices that require custom drivers will fail to work until the correct ones are installed. The system may still boot, and authentication will likely work since it's stored locally."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Install two 4 GB memory modules in the same colored slots."
    ],
    "explanation": "To achieve 8 GB of RAM and take full advantage of the dual-channel memory architecture for maximum performance, the technician should install two 4 GB memory modules in the same colored slots. The matching colors indicate a memory channel, and populating both slots in a channel enables the more efficient interleaved memory access. Installing a single module or modules in different colored slots would result in less efficient single-channel operation."

    "explanation": "The technician should investigate the Random Access Memory (RAM) first. A gradual system slowdown is a common symptom of faulty RAM modules. Furthermore, a three-beep code on startup often indicates a RAM issue. Storage problems typically result in consistently slow performance, not a gradual decline, and CPU issues are more likely to cause system freezes or reboots. The issue is with local applications, so the network is not the primary suspect."

    "explanation": "The most likely cause of the BSOD is an incorrect boot order in the BIOS. After installing the new drive, the BIOS may have set it as the primary boot device. Since this new drive doesn't have an operating system, the computer fails to boot and crashes. The technician needs to enter the BIOS and ensure the original hard drive with the operating system is set as the first boot priority."

    "explanation": "For the processor, a quad core CPU is recommended over a dual-core with hyperthreading because its superior performance is critical for the final rendering of videos. For video, a PCIe x16 video card should be used for its high throughput, which is essential for editing HD video. This is far superior to older standards like AGP or basic on-board graphics. For disk storage, four 3 TB solid-state drives (SSDs) are the best choice.

    ],
    "explanation": "Node C, the load balancer, will distribute incoming requests from users D and E across the two servers (F and G) using a set algorithm. Load balancers also provide redundancy; if one server (F) fails, the load balancer will detect this and send all traffic to the remaining healthy server (G). Node A, the router, is responsible for connecting different networks. When traffic needs to go from one subnet to another (e.g., 10.10.20.0 to 10.10.30.0), the router must perform lookups in its routing table to determine the correct path. Node B is a switch and does not cache web requests; that is the function of a proxy server. The router (Node A) would serve as the default gateway, not the load balancer."

RAID 1 actually has better write performance than RAID 5, so changing from RAID 1 to RAID 5 would not help."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "SSD drive"
    ],
    "explanation": "The technician should choose a solid-state drive (SSD). An SSD meets all the requirements: it is available in capacities well over 500 GB, can operate in extreme cold (as low as -55°C), and is highly resistant to physical shock because it has no moving parts. An HDD is susceptible to shock and cannot operate at such low temperatures. SDHC cards and Blu-ray discs do not meet the minimum capacity requirement."

    "explanation": "The most likely reason for choosing plenum-rated cable is to comply with fire safety standards. These cables have a special fire-retardant jacket that does not emit toxic fumes when burned, making them required for use in plenum spaces (areas with air circulation, like above ceilings or below floors). Plenum cables are more expensive and do not offer different speed or distance ratings compared to standard PVC cables."

    "correct_answer": [
      "d. Plug the four-pin connector into the three-pin header"
    ],
    "explanation": "The easiest solution that works to cool your CPU is to connect the four-pin connector into the three-pin header. The missing pin allows you to control the speed of the fan. Without it, the fan will run at top speed, which is fine, albeit a little noisier. There is no four-pin to three-pin power adapter. The heat sink alone should not be relied upon for proper cooling of modern CPUs, and an extra chassis fan isn't designed to specifically help cool the CPU."

    "explanation": "The reset button causes the computer to return to nearly the same point it is in when you power it on, but without the need for power cycling. Using Restart in the Start menu does not reboot as deeply as the reset button. Hibernation is a power state that completely removes power after saving the contents of RAM to the hard drive; pressing the power button is required to resume the session in the same manner as starting the computer after a complete shutdown. The power button cannot be used as a method of restarting the system."

Replacing the RAM or the CPU to see if it resolves the problem could be a good next step, but replacing three components at once is too many changes unless you have specific reason to believe it is all three. Reinstalling Windows is probably overkill as well. Narrow down the issue before implementing sweeping solutions such as that."

You should also teach them that a crossover cable has two different ends: one wired as 568A and the other as 568B. A straight-through cable is used for directly connecting cables to a wall jack, which enables that node to communicate with several devices, and both ends would be either 568A or 568B. Purchasing cable is not an option, as you are hired to teach them to make their own. While it is important that they know how to go about purchasing cable, it is most important that they be able to make it from raw materials. Most Ethernet cables are T568B, but at the time T568A components need to be connected to a T568B component, the crossover cable is recommended."

    "question": "You suspect that an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is malfunctioning. You need to test the output from the UPS using a multimeter. Which multimeter setting should you use?",
    "options": [
      "a. AC Voltage",
      "b. Ohms",
      "c. DC Voltage",
      "d. Continuity"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. AC Voltage"
    ],
    "explanation": "An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides AC power even when it is supplying power from its internal battery. This is true because components that you normally plug into a UPS, such as a monitor, are powered by AC current. However, it is easy to mistakenly associate a UPS with DC current because it contains a battery, which supplies DC current. This is not the case, because circuitry in the UPS takes DC power from the battery and converts it into AC current that monitors and computer systems can use. A multimeter is used to check power voltage coming from the power supply to the hard drive, motherboard, and other components. A power supply tester is used to check for proper power supply operation. This tool can go beyond a multimeter because it specialized in testing all functions of the power supply, including the Power_Good signal. For the A+ exam, you should be familiar with the following additional tools. A volt ohm meter (VOM) is used for most electrical measurements and for testing continuity. This meter can check voltage, AC or DC, ohms, AC circuits, DC circuits, batteries, milliamps, diodes, or capacitors. A current clamp, also referred to as a clamp-on current probe, enables a user to measure currents without breaking the electric circuit. Current clamps are designed with jaws that can be opened, placed around the conductor, and clamped to form a magnetic loop around the conductor. Current clamps offer a safe, simple, and accurate method for taking current measurements. A continuity meter (also known as a multimeter or a continuity tester) is used to check the continuity between two or more components on a circuit board to determine whether a circuit is open or closed. An open circuit cannot conduct electricity. A continuity meter determines whether the various components of a power supply are connected properly. In some applications, such as testing a power supply, a continuity meter is used along with a volt ohm meter. The continuity meter can ensure that components that should not to be connected are not connected, thereby preventing possible hazards while testing a power supply."

    "question": "After you start your computer, you hear an unusual, high-pitched noise. The source of the noise is the fan mounted inside the power supply. After a few minutes, the noise goes away. Which action should you take?",
    "options": [
      "a. Disable the power supply fan, and install a cooling fan card in an unoccupied PCI or ISA slot.",
      "b. Replace the power supply.",
      "c. Replace the fan assembly.",
      "d. Replace the bearings inside the fan motor.",
      "e. Lubricate the bearings inside the fan motor."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Replace the power supply."
    ],
    "explanation": "The power supply is a field replaceable unit (FRU). When the fan in the power supply stops functioning normally, you should replace the entire power supply. The power supply, which has potentially lethal voltages, should be repaired only by properly trained technicians. Be sure to use a replacement unit of the same or greater wattage and with the same type of output connectors because the system board connection for an AT or baby AT board is different from the connector for an ATX-style board. Also, check for any special features that the system board has. Some power supplies have a multispeed fan that uses a special control cable connected to the system board. When the interior of the case reaches a certain temperature, the fan speed is increased to provide additional cooling. Otherwise, the fan runs at a slower, quieter speed. Under all circumstances, the computer should be disconnected from the electrical outlet before any repair work on the power supply is begun. The fan inside the power supply is especially important for cooling the computer electronics. This fan exhausts hot air from the case, which causes cooler outside air to be drawn into the case. A cooling fan mounted on a card helps prevent hot spots inside the case by providing better interior circulation, but it will not exhaust hot air. The fan inside the power supply does not require lubrication or other maintenance such as bearing replacement. Loud noises or grinding noises usually originate from system fans, the power supply, or the hard drives, because very few internal devices have moving parts. While a grinding noise is most often associated with a hard drive failure, it can also come from a broken fan. The noise usually means that the component is close to failure. The CPU and power supply rely on these fans prevent overheating, so you should replace the part immediately. Smoke and burning smells are equally urgent issues, but usually easy to trace. Shut down the computer immediately and locate the device that is producing the smoke and/or burning smell, and replace that device. Another hardware-related issue you should recognize is swelling or distended capacitors. Capacitors are included in computers on the motherboards, video cards, and power supplies. Capacitors can fail prematurely, causing the capacitor's case to bulge or rupture. In most cases, the only way to fix this problem is to replace the card that has the swollen capacitor. It is possible to replace them, but the process requires soldering experience. Replacing the capacitor is an electrical hazard and should only be attempted with proper training."

The branch office does not contain a DHCP server. A user travels frequently between the head office and the branch office. You are configuring the IP address on this user's laptop. You must ensure that the user is able to connect to the Internet from both offices. How should you configure the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box on the user's laptop while expending the least administrative effort?",

      "c. Configure the General tab and the Alternate Configuration tab to use the DHCP server.",
      "d. Configure the General tab and the Alternate Configuration tab to use a static IP address from the branch office network range."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Configure the General tab to use the DHCP server at the head office. Configure a static IP address from the branch office network range on the Alternate Configuration tab."
    ],
    "explanation": "You should configure the General tab to use the DHCP server at the head office and configure a static IP address from the branch office network range on the Alternate Configuration tab. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses automatically to the hosts on the network. DHCP provides unique IP address to all the hosts. You should configure DHCP to assign IP addresses automatically. In this scenario, the head office contains a DHCP server. Therefore, configuring the General tab to use the DHCP server will ensure that the user's laptop automatically receives the IP address settings from the DHCP server when the user is in the head office. When the General tab is configured to use a DHCP server and there is no DHCP server located on the network, the alternate IP address settings are checked by the computer. If the alternate IP address settings are also not configured, then an IP address from the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) range (169.254.0.0 -169.254.255.255) is assigned to the computer. To ensure that the user is able to connect to the Internet from the branch office, you should configure the Alternate Configuration tab on the user's laptop to use a static IP address from the IP address range of the branch office network. This will ensure that the user's laptop uses the branch office's IP address settings when the user is in the branch office. You should not configure the General tab and the Alternate Configuration tab to use the DHCP server. There is no DHCP server on the branch office network in this scenario. Therefore, the user's laptop will receive an IP address from the APIPA range while in the branch office. This will not allow the user to connect to the Internet while in the branch office. You should not configure a static IP address from the head office network range on the General tab and configure a static IP address from the branch office network range on the Alternate Configuration tab. The head office contains a DHCP server in this scenario. Therefore, you should configure the General tab to use the DHCP server. You should not configure the General tab and the Alternate Configuration tab to use a static IP address from the branch office network range. Configuring the General tab to use a static IP address from the IP address range of the branch office network will not allow the user to connect to the Internet from the head office. IP addressing can be either dynamically configured by DHCP or manually configured by an IT technician. DHCP allows for centralized administration of IP settings, while manual configuration can be an administrative nightmare for large networks."

    "question": "In the process of implementing security for your cloud deployment, you need to specify access rights for the users. Your company has a large number of employees and several levels of management where an employee may need to delegate responsibility and grant access to other employees dynamically. What kind of access control will you need for this?",
    "options": [
      "a. Discretionary",
      "b. Non-discretionary",
      "c. Multifactor authentication",
      "d. Mandatory"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Discretionary"
    ],
    "explanation": "You would use discretionary access control. Discretionary access control (DAC) differs from mandatory access control (MAC) in that users can specify access rights to resources themselves as opposed to the centrally controlled security policy with MAC. This way, users who own resources like files or directories can then extend rights to other users based on their discretion. These users will then be able to take actions on these resources, which can include executing, reading, or writing. Non-discretionary access control specifies rules for access to cloud systems, objects, or services. It ensures that cloud resource access is determined by roles, rules, and privileges. Non-discretionary access and role-based access are synonymous. Some examples of non-discretionary access include allowing a user access to a fleet of servers to administer them, permitting access to servers for a limited period each day, or only allowing a group of users to access a sensitive document on the cloud. You should not use mandatory access control (MAC). MAC provides a very high level of security by comparing the user's credentials with the levels of access permitted to the resource being accessed. For example, if a user wants to access a hypervisor, the system will allow access only if the user's account has full hypervisor management rights. MAC systems offer a highly controlled means of access and are used in defense or finance systems where security is of paramount importance. In MAC systems, access to less sensitive data is controlled as much than with sensitive data. Additionally, users who are allowed access cannot add other users or even modify the security policy of the system, which is centrally controlled. Multifactor authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security by using multiple authenticating factors. Factors of authentication include something you have (token or smart card), something you know (pin or security question), and something you are (biometrics). As an example, when withdrawing money at a bank's automated teller, you use the ATM card (something you have) and the numeric PIN (something you know). Similarly, MFA systems can generate an electronic token that is valid for a short period of time and must be entered when authenticating, along with the existing username and password. Token generators can exist as hardware, as keychain-based devices, or as software that executes on laptops and smartphones."

    "explanation": "You should ensure the Connect even if the network is not broadcasting option on the Connections tab of the Wireless Network Properties page is cleared. If this option is enabled, probe requests are sent to discover if a non-broadcast network is in range. You should not change the configuration of the Connect automatically when this network is in range option. This option ensures that the connection is reestablished when the wireless network is detected. When you disable automatic configuration of an SSID, the SSID is not automatically transmitted to all computers within the wireless network range. This provides a low level of security. The only way to connect to the wireless network is to enter the SSID manually."

    "correct_answer": [
      "b. All of these components"
    ],
    "explanation": "You can expect all of the listed components to be included in a cloud-based solution for an IT infrastructure. Cloud architecture consists of multiple users accessing cloud services remotely. These services are provided using servers that can be located in various global regions while operating as a single unified entity. This way, the same computing resource is shared by various consumers. Hosts on a network are computers that can interact with each other. These include clients and servers. A cloud host can be a collection of servers that perform as a single entity to provide services. This allows cloud consumers to target hosts that are required specifically for their needs. An example of this is a web server, which can be implemented via cloud computing with the actual servers located in different geographical regions. Certain cloud elements are found in every cloud implementation; this includes network components and services, application components, storage components, compute components, and security components. Depending on the service model implement, the level of control over and responsibility for these components will be distributed between the client and the cloud provider. Network components and services include network routing and switching services, including Domain Name Systems (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and load balancing services. Application components include all software applications that are required by end users, including email, web servers, databases, large data storage, and business application programs. Storage components include magnetic storage devices and solid-state drives (SSDs). Cloud storage systems have file-based, block-based, and even object-based systems for storage. Storage options range from high performance and high availability storage to less expensive options better suited for archiving purposes. Cloud storage components and services are made available via massive storage arrays and networks dedicated to storage. Compute components include resources that provide centralized processing of data using physical or virtual servers that run various operating systems. Security components include the means of securing data, such as access control mechanisms, encryption services, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems."

      "a. Lightning"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should choose a Lightning cable. Lightning cables are proprietary to Apple devices and feature an 8-pin connector that can be inserted in either direction (meaning there is no top or bottom to this connector). The cable was introduced in 2012 as a replacement for the older 30-pin connector, beginning with the iPhone 5, iPod Touch and the iPod Nano, and is still used with the latest generation of iPhone 13 and iPhone SE devices. You should not choose a Micro-USB, Mini-USB, or USB-C cable. These cables are used in many portable devices, but the Apple iPhone 11 uses a proprietary Lightning connector. The Mini-USB connector was a technology that was invented to help facilitate the process of transferring data between a PC and another digital device. The Micro-USB connector was a significantly smaller version of the Mini-USB that was created to be used with many non-Apple portable devices, such as phones and tablets. Future standards may force Apple to make iPhones compatible with USB-C cables, but as of this writing, Lightning is the current cable standard. You should not choose an IEEE 1394 cable, also referred to as FireWire. While it was used in early versions of Apple mobile devices and consumer electronics, FireWire is not used in iPhone 11. Other proprietary vendor-specific ports for communication and power include Thunderbolt for Apple devices. Note that Apple's Thunderbolt cable has a USB-C form factor, but it is not used with iPhones. Thunderbolt cables are data transfer cables used with Mac computers. The current standards are Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. Virtual technology"
    ],
    "explanation": "Virtual technology would be the most important CPU or motherboard feature to configure. Virtual technology allows you to install another operating system on top of the existing operating system without overwriting the original OS. You install a hypervisor, such as Oracle Virtual Box or VMware's VM Player, and then install the desired operating system within the hypervisor. In essence, the newly installed operating system launches like an application, but has the same functionality as an operating system that was installed directly on the host system. Virtualization technology is typically disabled in the BIOS. To enable the virtualization feature, go into the BIOS menu, look for Intel Virtualization Technology or AMD-V, and enable it. None of the other features would help the students install one operating system within another on their laptops. Hyperthreading allows a processor to execute two threads of code at the same time. Before hyperthreading, a single-core processor could only process one thing at a time. With multicore processors, each core is divided virtually, and each virtual core can work on separate sets of instructions. This process greatly increases processor efficiency. Configuring processor speed is also known as overclocking. Overclocking can increase the speed at which the processor operates, but it also generates significant heat, and should not be implemented without an enhanced cooling system. With an integrated GPU, you want to ensure that you have the latest drivers from the manufacturer. If you need additional graphics performance, consider adding a third-party graphics card and disabling the integrated GPU."

    "explanation": "The video card is most likely to be replaced by a similar device that is not an internal component but rather attached with an external USB adapter. Video card replacement on a laptop is often not possible because the card is usually built into the motherboard. The best bet is to install an external graphics card though the USB port. As compared to video card replacement in a laptop, Bluetooth module replacement is a relatively easy and inexpensive process, though there are several steps to get to where you can pull out the old one and install the new one. As compared to video card replacement in a laptop, cellular card replacement is a relatively easy process. Some cellular cards can simply be plugged into a USB port. When purchasing a replacement, look for a wireless wide area networking (WWAN) card that has at minimum 4G and LTE capability. Follow the manufacturer's disassembly steps to remove the old unit and replace it with the new one. A DC jack cannot be plugged into an external USB adapter. The DC jack can be replaced on a laptop, but it is not easy. More often than not, the process involves de-soldering the broken jack from the motherboard, removing the broken jack, placing the new jack, and soldering it in place.

    "correct_answer": [
      "c. A defective hub port",
      "d. A defective NIC in the file server"
    ],
    "explanation": "Either a defective network interface card (NIC) on the file server or a defective hub port connected to the file server would prevent users from connecting to the file server. In either situation, users would be able to connect to each other. A defective cable between the hub and the file server would also prevent communications between users and the server. To verify that the problem is a hardware issue, you should investigate the hub connection. To do so, simply connect the cable from the server into another port on the hub that you know is functioning properly. If the server connectivity is restored, then the hub is the most likely source of the problem. Note that a hub is sometimes called a concentrator. Client/server communication problems can also be related to software issues. For instance, Brad may not have permission to access the file server, or he may not have the correct name or address of the file server. In a network with multiple subnets, communication problems can be caused by incorrect subnet mask settings or an incorrect gateway address. Troubleshooting normally includes determining which users are affected; what settings are in place on the computers that have problems communicating; and whether the problem is localized to a single computer, to a single subnet, or to an entire network. Because hosts on 10BaseT networks connect to a central device, such as a hub, 10BaseT networks do not require the use of terminators. By contrast, hosts in 10Base2 networks connect directly to other hosts instead of to a central hub; consequently, 10Base2 networks require the use of terminators. An improper termination in a 10Base2 network can cause an entire network segment to lose connectivity. A defective NIC in Brad's computer would prevent connection to other network resources such as folders on other computers."

    "question": "Which TCP/IP configuration information must a computer on a network have before it can communicate with the Internet? (Choose three.)",
    "options": [
      "a. Proxy server address",
      "b. Default gateway",
      "c. TCP/IP address",
      "d. FTP server address",

    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Default gateway",
      "g. Subnet mask",
      "c. TCP/IP address"
    ],
    "explanation": "Before any computer on a network can communicate with the Internet, it will need an IP address, a default gateway, and a subnet mask. You can supply this information manually (often referred to as a static IP address), or you can use a DCHP server to supply this information automatically (often referred to as a dynamic IP address). If a computer is configured to obtain an IP address automatically, it will contact a DHCP for all client-side DHCP information. The IP address is a 32-digit binary number that is needed to identify each device, or host, on the Internet. The IP address provides a logical address for each device. The subnet mask is used to block out a portion of the IP address. The purpose of the blocking is to distinguish the network ID from the host ID. It is also used to identify whether the IP address of the destination host is on a local network or on a remote network. Subnet mask addresses are 32-bit numbers. Every host on a TCP/IP network will need to be configured with a subnet mask. Use the default subnet mask if you are not dividing your network into subnets. You will need to create custom subnet addresses if your networks are to be divided into subnets. The default gateway is the address of the default router. While you can configure a static IP address, meaning that the IP address is manually entered in the computer's settings, it is considered a best practice to configure the computer to obtain an IP address automatically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Another important part of the IP settings includes configuring the address of the Domain Name System (DNS) server."

    "question": "You administer your company's 100BaseTX Ethernet network. TCP/IP is the networking protocol used on the network. You want the routers on the network to send you notices when they have exceeded specified performance thresholds. Which protocol should you use to enable the routers to send the notices?",
    "options": [
      "a. Telnet",
      "b. SNMP",
      "c. SMTP",
      "d. ARP"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. SNMP"
    ],
    "explanation": "Of the protocols presented, you should use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to enable the routers to notify you when they exceed specified performance thresholds. SNMP is a protocol in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite that enables the collection of data about various devices connected to a TCP/IP network, including bridges, hubs, and routers. Each SNMP-compatible device has a Management Information Base (MIB) database that defines the type of information that can be collected about the device. You can also configure SNMP traps to analyze network performance and network problems. A trap is a message that an SNMP-compatible device sends when the device has exceeded a performance threshold. You can configure SNMP to send traps to the network management software you are using, to your email address, or to another destination. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on a TCP/IP network to resolve Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to media access control (MAC) addresses. TCP/IP uses IP addresses to identify hosts, whereas Ethernet uses MAC addresses to identify network nodes. For Ethernet and TCP/IP to interoperate, a host's IP address must be resolved to a MAC address. You cannot use ARP to notify you when network devices have exceeded performance thresholds. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transfer email messages from email clients to email servers. SMTP is also used to transfer email messages between email servers. SMTP will not send traps when network devices have exceeded performance thresholds. Telnet is a terminal emulation protocol. You can use Telnet to establish a remote session with a server from a local host through a terminal window to issue commands on the remote server. Telnet client software provides you with a text-based interface and a command line from which you can issue commands on a server that supports the Telnet protocol. Telnet will not send notices when network devices have exceeded established performance thresholds."

    "question": "You bought a monochrome laser printer two years ago. The printer has gradually stopped feeding paper. Which printer component should you check first?",
    "options": [
      "a. Pressure roller",
      "b. Transfer roller",
      "c. Pickup roller",
      "d. Fuser roller"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "c. Pickup roller"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should first check your pickup roller printer component if your laser printer stops feeding paper. A pickup roller acts as the first point of contact between printer and paper because the pickup roller draws the paper from the paper tray into the printer. A malfunctioning pickup roller can cause false paper jams wherein the printer is not able to pick up the paper from the tray because the pickup roller fails to turn. You should not check a fuser roller printer component if your laser printer stops feeding paper. A fuser roller is a printer component that helps in binding the toner ink to the delicate paper fibers so that the images stick to the paper properly. You should not check a pressure roller printer component if your laser printer stops feeding paper. A pressure roller is a printer component that applies pressure against the fuser roller while paper is passing through them for printing inside the printer. You should not check a transfer roller printer component if your laser printer stops feeding paper. A transfer roller is a printer component that is used to transfer the image from the photoreceptor to the paper. If the printer is jamming right before the fuser, you need to replace the transfer roller. Always keep in mind that you should check the obvious first when troubleshooting a printer. If the printer is not printing, you should make sure it is plugged in and turned on. You should also make sure that it has paper. Most technicians can tell you stories about how they were called in for troubleshooting an issue that had a very obvious fix. Also, keep in mind that some internal components should only be replaced by individuals who are experienced in repairing printers. These printer technicians are usually employed by the vendor from which you purchased the printer."

    "question": "You have recently moved your company's web server to a cloud deployment. You previously had over one million users accessing the web server from across the world. Before the server is made available to the public, you need to verify that the server will meet its performance standards after the deployment to the cloud. Which testing technique should you use?",
    "options": [
      "a. Penetration testing",
      "b. Load Testing",
      "c. Vulnerability testing",
      "d. Simulation testing"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Load Testing"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should use load testing. Load testing will help ascertain if the web server can perform as expected under the load of servicing usual network traffic. Vulnerability and penetration testing do not test system performance under loads. They are used for checking the security of a system. After a company's operations are deployed into a cloud environment, you must test it to verify that the deployment is working as expected. There are three key testing techniques that are used: Vulnerability testing or vulnerability scanning - This involves checking the cloud deployment for any objects that may be unsecure. The scanner has a database of known exploits and checks each object in the cloud environment against these, including operating systems and applications. After the scan is complete, a report is generated on all detected security threats. Penetration testing – This involves testing the accessibility of a cloud from outside the cloud to ensure that it is secure from illegal access. Penetration testing helps identify any vulnerability that may be exploited by a hacker to allow access from outside the cloud. Load testing - This involves placing your cloud system under a load to determine its capacity for dealing with computational demands. This way, you can identify exactly how your cloud deployment will behave when there is a heavy load on the system. Both average use and peak use is considered when performing load testing. Because each system is expected to fail eventually when placed under a severe load, load testing helps to pinpoint issues in the system's design and fix any bugs that may be causing performance issues. You should not use simulation testing. Simulation testing is a form of walkthrough drill that a company can use to test its preparedness for a disaster as per its Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)."

Your team has been working for a week to configure an ideal virtual machine with all of the required applications and settings. Now you need to create 100 additional identical virtual machines. What is the most efficient way to do this?",
    "options": [
      "a. Cloning",
      "b. Hotfixes",
      "c. Patching",
      "d. Snapshots"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Cloning"
    ],
    "explanation": "Cloning is the most efficient way to create identical virtual machines. The cloning process takes a master image of a virtual machine and duplicates it to create identical new virtual machines. Each of the cloned VMs receives a different universally unique identifier (UUID) and media access control (MAC) address to prevent any conflict with the original server it was cloned from. The key difference between cloning and taking a snapshot is that a snapshot is used to revert a virtual machine to an older state, while cloning is used to create new virtual machines based on an existing one. To create a new VM from a snapshot, you must first convert the snapshot into a master image. Snapshots are created using management tools provided for working in the cloud's virtual environment. The snapshot is stored as a file and contains a copy of the virtual machine's state, including its operating system and application state. It also includes the data stored on the virtual machine at that time and its complete configuration. A snapshot is created as the virtual machine is running. Snapshots can be used for rollbacks and backups as well as point-in-time restores. You should not create a hotfix. A hotfix is a software update aimed at resolving an immediate issue with the software. Hotfixes do not have to be public releases, but can be made for specific customers. Hotfixes are usually geared towards fast deployment for rectifying bugs, meaning that they do not follow the same quality assurance (QA) and testing procedures as with a formal software release or version update. Because hotfixes can sometimes introduce new bugs into the application, you need to weigh the severity of the existing bug with the risk of new bugs that may be introduced. It might be better to defer the fix until the next proper version update, which should have a full QA testing process. You should not create a patch. A patch is an update that fixes a known problem with the software application or operating system. Patches are intended to address security issues or improve the performance of the software. They do not add additional features, but remove undesirable behavior in the software and improve usability."

    "question": "You are setting up an 802.11a wireless network in a small office environment that includes three wireless access points. The wireless access points are at least 15 meters apart and are configured for automatic channel setting. Each time you turn the wireless access points on, they choose the same channel. You need to ensure that the access points choose separate channels to prevent interference, using the least amount of administrative effort. What should you do?",
    "options": [
      "a. Manually configure each of the access points to use channels 1, 6, and 11, respectively.",
      "b. Increase the distance between the wireless access points to at least 20 meters",
      "c. Reduce the signal strength on each access point.",
      "d. Start each wireless access point at a separate time."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. Start each wireless access point at a separate time."
    ],
    "explanation": "You should start each wireless access point at a separate time. This will allow each access point to select a channel. Then, when the next access point is booted, it will detect the other access points' channels and use another channel besides the ones detected. 802.11a wireless access points have eight available nonoverlapping channels: 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, and 64. 802.11a products need to be configured for automatic channel selection. Therefore, you cannot manually configure the channel. With the automatic channel selection feature, 802.11a wireless access points can detect other access points and configure their channel accordingly. This is the reason that it is important to start 802.11a wireless access points at a separate time. The suggested range for 802.11a wireless access points is 30 meters in an open space and 10 meters in an office environment. You should not increase the distance between the wireless access points to at least 20 meters. For 802.11a wireless access points, the suggested distance in an office environment is 10 meters. You should not manually configure each of the access points to use channels 1, 6, and 11, respectively. These are the nonoverlapping channels used by 802.11b and 802.11g devices. You should alternate between these three channels when using 802.11b or 802.11g wireless access points. The suggested range for 802.11b and 802.11g wireless access points is 120 meters in an open space and 30 meters in an office environment. You should not reduce the signal strength on each access point. This would require more administrative effort than is necessary to fix your problem. In addition, reducing the signal strength could cause problems for some wireless clients that are now outside the new range. It is much simpler to turn the wireless access points on at different times."

    "correct_answer": [
      "c. USB port adapters",
      "d. DisplayPort ports",
      "a. VGA ports"
    ],
    "explanation": "The trainers will probably use DisplayPort ports, VGA ports, and USB port adapters. DisplayPort is an interface developed by Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). It connects video sources to a computer monitor and can carry audio, USB, and other forms of data to various devices. VGA ports are legacy ports and are old-style connectors that are no longer widely used. Some laptops do include these for backward compatibility. Older projectors may include a VGA port. A USB port is a standard interface for most computers and consumer electronic devices, such as MP3 players, speakers, and monitors. Thunderbolt 3 and 4 cables use USB-C ports. USB port adapters allow you to connect non-USB devices to a USB port. Common USB adapters will interface with HDMI (which is included in most projectors), Bluetooth, or VGA devices. ExpressCard ports are interfaces that connect peripheral devices to laptops. ExpressCard devices include modem cards, Ethernet cards, storage devices, and TV tuner cards. ExpressCard is most commonly used to connect with external storage devices and networks, which makes it of limited use for multimedia presentations. RJ-45 ports are used to connect devices such as laptops or VoIP phones to Ethernet networks. Display devices do not connect to these ports. Audio jacks are ports used to connect speakers and microphones to a laptop. In most cases, both video and audio are transmitted through the DisplayPort port, so it is likely the trainers will not use this technology. USB to Wi-Fi dongles or wireless adapters create hot spots for mobile devices and are compatible with USB 3.0 and 2.0. Wi-Fi dongle/adapters support 802.11 standards a, b, g, and n, and encryption."

    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Router/switch functionality"
    ],
    "explanation": "You will most likely need to assist the user with router/switch functionality. The user is most likely describing an 802.11ac router with a built-in switch. For most small office home office (SOHO) routers, router/switch functionality can be accomplished by running an Ethernet patch cable from a desktop or laptop computer to the router. The IP address (usually 192.168.1.1) is often printed on the bottom of the router, as well as the default username and password. Once you have the IP address, username, and password, open a browser and type in the address. In most circumstances, you will be asked for the username and password. If you entered the IP address, username, and password correctly, you will be able to see the interface used to configure the router/switch functionality you require. The user is not describing an issue with wired or wireless NIC configuration. In Windows 10, NICs can be configured by going to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > View network status and tasks > Change adapter settings, and then selecting the adapter, typically labeled Ethernet. When you right-click the adapter, you will see a pop-up menu where you can adjust the most common settings. Configuring wireless encryption would provide enhanced security, but would not help with the initial configuration issue being described. Cable/DSL modem is not the most likely answer. Cable and DSL modems do not have multiple antennas for wireless. They typically serve as the default gateway for a SOHO network. Cable modems are a type of network bridge that allows for data communication via radio frequency channels to deliver broadband internent access in the form of cabling. DSL is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines."

    ],
    "explanation": "If you frequently roam outside of your local area and need to update the list of cell towers on your phone to provide better coverage, you would perform a preferred roaming list (PRL) update. PRL allows cell phones to connect to the right provider's tower when roaming to stay in network. You can manually update the PRL on most phones simply by restarting the phone, or by turning Airplane mode on and off again to reset your network connection. Some manufacturers and carriers let you dial a specific number to download the update. For example, to update the PRL on a CDMA iPhone, tap the call button, enter ##873283#, then tap the call button again to dial. You will get a message that it is starting the update, followed by another message saying it is complete. To update the PRL on some Android phones, dial *228 and follow the prompts. A baseband update will update the radio firmware on the cell phone. The baseband OS is separate from the device OS. The baseband OS runs the phone's wireless communication chip, also called the radio or radio firmware, which provides all cellular calling, texting, GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi capabilities. Baseband updates are rolled into OS updates or carrier setting updates for iPhones and Android devices, and delivered automatically by the carrier. You can manually update the baseband on Android devices by installing a new radio.zip file in the root directory, but doing so incorrectly will brick the device. Apple devices do not support manual baseband updates unless the device is jailbroken. To find the baseband version an iPhone is running, go to Settings > General > About > Modem firmware. To find it on an Android phone, go to Settings > About Phone > Software information > Baseband version. PRI updates are automatic downloads from your carrier. Primary Rate Interface (PRI) is a telecommunications interface standard. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are mobile technologies that were used in in 2G and 3G communications. With 2G and 3G communications, carriers could not pick between the GSM and CDMA technologies, which resulted in the Federal Communications Commission ruling that a “dual-mode” route was required and forcing companies to use either GSM or CDMA. However, with the invention of 4G and 5G, both GSM and CDMA are being or have been phased out in favor of modern communications with LTE. 2022 is the last year for major cell providers to support 3G."

    "explanation": "The diffuser component is the most likely cause of the problem. The diffuser takes the points of light and uniformly spreads them out over the entire area of the display. An LCD is mounted onto an inverter or backlight assembly to provide backlight to the display. Usually, fluorescent tubes are used for backlighting in LCDs. The light is dispersed by a plastic plate around the entire area of the display. A diffuser is placed on top of the dispersion plate. Backlights use AC power, not DC. Inverters are any component that converts the direct current (DC) power being used to power the device into the alternating current (AC) power used by the backlight. Deflection yokes and electron guns are not used in LCD monitors. These two components are used in cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. An electron gun contains a heater, cathode, focusing anode, and accelerating anode for three electron beams. An electron gun creates electrons and then accelerates them to a high speed. The deflection yoke is placed around the CRT's neck and creates a magnetic field that controls the direction of the electron beams. The deflection yoke guides the electron beams to strike the proper position on the screen. Vertical-alignment displays are a variety of LCD technology, not a display component."

Because an application is not typically responsible for transmitting data packets across a network, the application in this scenario cannot drop the packets. Instead, an application that uses UDP will usually detect that UDP has dropped packets, and the application will retransmit any dropped packets. Other connectionless protocols, such as IP and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), function similarly to UDP. For example, if the application in this scenario were using IPX to transmit data, then IPX would drop the lost packets and the application would retransmit the dropped packets. A connection-oriented protocol, such as TCP or Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX), will automatically retransmit dropped packets without the intervention of a higher-level protocol or application."

      "d. Missing default gateway"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. Missing default gateway"
    ],
    "explanation": "A default gateway must be specified for a host for it to connect to hosts outside the local network. This address is the address of the router interface on the local segment that forwards data to other networks. On small networks, the default gateway is the address of the router that connects the local network to the Internet. From the output of the ipconfig utility, you can see that no default gateway is configured for the host. You must configure the proper default gateway for the host. This can be done manually or using DHCP to automatically assign the appropriate addressing information. The IP address, subnet mask, and Ethernet adapter address are all valid in this scenario. The subnet mask is used to assign a computer to a specific network segment. The IP address identifies the computer on the network. For the A+ exam, you must understand how to troubleshoot the following wired and wireless network symptoms:"

You want to enable the hosts on your network to be automatically configured with IP configurations such as an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway address. The IP configurations should be leased to the clients for a limited period. Which protocol should you use to accomplish this task?",

      "e. DHCP"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "e. DHCP"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically configure the hosts on your network with IP configurations. DHCP was designed to automatically configure frequently moved, fully boot-capable computers, such as laptop computers, with IP configurations. You can use DHCP to configure such IP settings as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway address. Typically, DHCP information is leased to a client for a limited period. DHCP clients usually release DHCP information when they are shut down. When a DHCP client retrieves IP configurations from a DHCP server, the DHCP client does not necessarily have the same IP configurations that it was configured with on previous occasions. BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a host configuration protocol that was designed before DHCP. BOOTP was designed to configure diskless workstations with IP configurations. BOOTP does not lease IP configuration as DHCP does. Instead, a BOOTP server permanently assigns IP configurations to a BOOTP client. When a BOOTP client is started, the BOOTP server always assigns the same IP configurations to the BOOTP client. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to transfer web pages on a TCP/IP network. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transfer email messages on a TCP/IP network. Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is used to enable network printing through a TCP/IP network such as the Internet. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols that are used by internet-based applications. TCP provides reliable and properly ordered data flows that is also capable of checking data delivery for any errors that may have occurred. HTTP, SMTP, and IPP are not used to automatically configure hosts on a TCP/IP network with IP settings."

    "options": [
      "a. An ATX motherboard has a 12-pin power connector.",
      "b. An ATX motherboard can support Extended Data Output (EDO) Random Access Memory (RAM).",

      "d. The processor, memory, and expansion slots on an ATX motherboard are all in line with each other."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "c. An ATX motherboard can support a maximum of seven expansion slots."
    ],
    "explanation": "An Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) motherboard can support a maximum of seven expansion slots. ATX motherboards are generally an improvement over AT and baby AT motherboards and provide more space for expansion slots, such as Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) card slots. An ATX motherboard supports a 20-pin power connector, which consists of a single connector that can only be connected in one way to the motherboard. A 12-pin power connector is supported on AT and baby AT motherboards, and is a combination of two 6-pin power connectors where the P8 and P9 pins are together. Therefore, you must ensure that the black wires are adjacent to each other while connecting a 12-pin power connector to the motherboard. The ATX power supply standard was developed to provide a better way to plug the power supply into the motherboard. The processor, memory, and expansion slots are NOT in line with each other on an ATX motherboard. The memory slot on an ATX motherboard, also referred to as a RAM slot, is placed at a 90-degree angle to all expansion slots. The processor, memory, and expansion slots are oriented parallel to each other on AT and baby AT motherboards. An ATX motherboard cannot support EDO RAM, which is considered obsolete. Micro-ATX, ITX, and Mini-ITX use the 20- or 24-pin power connectors. A 24-pin power connector is similar to the 20-pin power connector, except that it has four more pins. Whenever connecting different components to a motherboard, it is important to match connectors appropriately to ensure that everything is functioning properly. Depending on the device, different pin header connectors will be required. A connector that you will need to be familiar with on a motherboard are Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) connectors. The SAS connector was developed for transferring data between storage. The goal of the SAS port was to have similar functions of a SATA port, but with the ability to support several hard drives simultaneously."

    "correct_answer": [
      "d. Mutual authentication"
    ],
    "explanation": "Authentication where the client authenticates the server and server authenticates the client is known as mutual authentication. Most authentication relies on the client authentication but does not include server authentication. Multifactor authentication requires the user to provide two pieces of information from what they know (username/password), what a user has (a security token or badge), who the user is (biometrics), or where the user is (location). It takes at least one factor from two of those categories to be multifactor authentication. Two factors from within the same category, such as username and password, are considered single factor authentication. Single sign-on allows a user to use a single login and authentication to access multiple systems and applications. Biometric authentication requires some type of biological identification, such as fingerprints, retinal scans, iris scan, or voiceprints. Both Android and iOS devices support mutual authentication for multiple services, typically using SSL. One of the challenges of using this authentication for mobile devices is their relative lack of processing power when compared with desktop and laptop systems."

    "correct_answer": [
      "b. IMEI is the serial number for the mobile device, and IMSI is the number assigned to the SIM card."
    ],
    "explanation": "International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is the serial number for the mobile device, and International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is the number assigned to the SIM card. IMEI stands for and is a unique serial number assigned to the phone at the time of manufacture. The IMSI contains a mobile country code, a mobile network code, and a Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (commonly referred to as a phone number). If you change the SIM card, you can get a new phone number, but the IMEI will remain the same. IMEI is a 19-digit code assigned to the mobile device. It has the following components: Type Approval Code (TAC) – a centrally assigned six-digit number. Final Assembly Code (FAC) – a six-digit number assigned by the manufacturer. Serial Number (SNR) – a six-digit sequential number assigned by the manufacturer as it comes off the assembly line. Spare (SP) - a one-digit number for future use. IMSI is a 15-digit number (maximum) comprised of the following: Mobile Country Code (MCC) – a three-digit standardized number that indicates the country. Mobile Network Code (MNC) – a two-digit number that identifies the mobile network (carrier) within the MCC. Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) – This is a maximum ten-digit number that identifies the subscriber's telephone number in the home mobile network. As an example, if we commonly refer to a cell phone number as 2051234567, we are actually referring to the MSIN. Androids and iPhones do not use different terms to describe their device serial numbers."

    "options": [
      "a. Reservation",
      "b. Link-Local Address",
      "c. NAT",
      "d. VLAN"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. VLAN"
    ],
    "explanation": "A virtual LAN (VLAN) allows you to segregate network traffic based on the switch port connections. As an example, if computers in the Marketing department are connected to ports 3, 6, 12 and 14, those ports can be assigned to VLAN100. If computers in the Accounting department are connected to ports 4, 15, 17, and 20, they can be assigned to VLAN200. In this configuration, computers on VLAN100 would be segregated from computers on VLAN200. VLAN assignments can span multiple switches, but each switch port can only belong to one VLAN. By default, all switch ports are assigned to VLAN1. Link local addresses in IPv6 begin with FE80::. In IPv6, link-local addressing functions much in the same way that Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) does in IPv4, but link-local addresses are created whether or not DHCP is present. In IPv4, an IP address of 169.254.x.x will be assigned when DHCP server is not available. An APIPA address allows the computer to communicate with other devices on the network. Link-local and APIPA addresses are not routable addresses. DHCP reservations allow you to assign a relatively permanent IP address to a specific device. When the reservation is created, the IP address is assigned to the device's MAC address. When the device sends out a DHCP query, the reservation is assigned based on the information in its record. It is often advantageous to assign a static IP address to devices like wireless access points, printers, servers, and routers. You can also create a pool of reserved address, such as 192.168.1.200 through 192.168.1.250, to allow for future static assignments. Network Address Translation (NAT) allows for the use of a private, non-routable IP address in an internal network. Upon receiving the outbound traffic from the internal network, the router substitutes a routable public IP address and forwards the traffic. When the traffic comes back to the router, the router translates the public address back to the private address and forwards the traffic back to the device on the internal network. Private address are IP addresses that are solely used within a local area network to differentiate different network devices when sending and receiving data streams. Public addresses are Internet-facing addresses that allow devices to communicate with each other that are on separate networks through an internet connection. The most common type of NAT is Port Address Translation (PAT), where the private IP address is assigned an ephemeral port number, and that number is appended to the router's public IP address."

    "explanation": "Solid state drives or SSD do NOT use a read/write assembly. A solid state drive does not have any moving parts. They are not as fragile as magnetic hard drives because they do not have any moving parts and are resistant to shock. When in operation, solid state drives are silent. Solid state drives are faster, more reliable, and require less power than magnetic drives. Solid state drives do NOT require an external power source. They pull electrical current for operation from the USB drive. Serial ATA (SATA) solid state drives do require electricity by plugging into the power supply. Flash drives are solid state drives. IDE hard drives, CD-ROM drives, DVD drives, and tape drives are all considered magnetic media. For some time now, tape drives have been the primary means of offsite storage of data backups. More companies are moving toward optical media and drives for backup storage. There are hybrid and embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) versions of solid state drives (SSDs) that work mainly in portable devices, but are also used to troubleshoot hard drive failures due to their SATA port compatibility. Hybrid drives are a combination of a hard drive with some moving parts and a true SSD, which is basically flash memory. The data is stored differently, but serves the same purpose by giving users a performance like an SSD. SSD cards are preferred over eMMC cards."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. The power supply is bad."
    ],
    "explanation": "The most likely reason for this problem is a bad power supply. A power supply unit (PSU) provides power to the computer. If the power supply is faulty, it will not provide the necessary power voltage, and the computer will not power up. This problem could also be caused by the power cord not being connected to the power source properly or by the power strip or surge protector being powered down. Technicians should always check for the most obvious problems first. However, in this case, checking the power cable or surge protector was not an option. Faulty memory does not stop the computer from powering on. You would receive a string of beeps during the boot process or an error message in case of faulty memory. An overheated CPU will cause the computer to reboot randomly, but will not prevent the computer from being powered on. An overheated CPU can be caused by a bad heat sink, poor air flow, open expansion slots in the case, or a faulty fan attached to the CPU. A crashed hard drive does not prevent the system from being powered on. The hard drive is a storage device that retains data even when there is no power. You will receive an error message if the hard drive has crashed, but the computer will still be powered on. If the hard drive starts making a grinding noise or giving off a burnt odor, you should replace the drive before it crashes completely. You can also experience power supply issues if the devices installed in the computer require more power than the power supply is capable of providing. If a computer's internal power needs are greater then what the power supply can provide, you need to upgrade the power supply. If the power supply wattage is too low, the computer will be unable to boot or internal devices will not function. Other problems that may be the result of a bad, insufficient, or failing power supply include occasional rebooting, overheating, electric shock felt on computer case, and the hard drive ceasing to work. Another issue to note is distended capacitors or capacitor swelling. Capacitors are included in computers on the motherboards, video cards, and power supplies. Capacitors can fail prematurely, causing the capacitor's case to bulge or rupture. In most cases, the only way to fix this problem is to replace the card that has the swollen capacitor. It is possible to replace them, but the process requires soldering experience. Replacing the capacitor is an electrical hazard and should only be attempted with proper training."

This model provides the necessary hardware via cloud that the company can then use to run its applications and even install a customized operating system. None of the other models would allow the installation and use of a customized OS. They are better suited for needs related to consumers who want an existing software environment. Cloud computing is the provision of computational services made available to consumers by cloud providers based on their need or consumption. These services cover both the use of platforms and applications as well as physical hardware resources. PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS are the three primary cloud service models that provide services accessible by web browsers, cell phones, and similar devices. The Platform as a Service (PaaS) service model allows consumers to bring their own applications and data to a cloud platform that provides compute services, operating systems, networking, storage, and all the necessary hardware. This allows consumers to quickly deploy their own applications without the burden of first establishing their infrastructure and operating environment. The Software as a Service (SaaS) model lets customers use software applications that run on a provider's cloud infrastructure. These applications can be accessed using thin client interfaces, including cell phones and web browsers. An example of this is email accessible from a web browser, such as Gmail. The advantage of this model is that a consumer can use the application without locally installing it or being concerned about the infrastructure needed to run it. The cloud provider takes full responsibility for running the application and managing it. Other examples of SaaS include enterprise resource planning (ERP), software development programs, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and human resources (HR) applications. Software applications for storage, networking, and processing also comprise the SaaS model. The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service model provides barebones computing resources, such as physical hardware and networking services, so that consumers can install operating systems of their choice and run any applications they wish. The advantage of this model is that a company's existing data center hardware resources can be completely replaced with a cloud-based solution. IaaS service models provide networking, storage, processing, and other basic computing resources for consumers. Other cloud service models include: Communications as a Service (CaaS) – This service model includes video conferencing, chat, voice calling, emailing, and other means of collaboration. Anything as a Service (XaaS) – This service model includes the provision of complete IT solutions as a consolidated unified package covering end-to-end services. Desktop as a Service (DaaS) – This service model provides a virtual desktop that can be accessed by a variety of devices, including laptops, tablets, and cell phones. The desktop has all of the applications typically required by business workflows, including word processors and spreadsheets. Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) – This service model provides applications supporting routine business operations such as shipping, orders, inventory, and payroll."

      "d. Print a test page"
    ],
    "explanation": "The first step toward ensuring that the inkjet printer is working properly is to print a test page. This page typically contains printer-related information, such as the printer's driver, data format, model, and configuration. To print a test page, you can invoke the printer's properties page and print the test page. A number of printer manufacturers provide printer management utilities that you can use to configure the printer and print a test page. You typically print a test page after you have configured the printer on a computer. After configuring the printer, you should print a test page. If the test page is printed, you have configured the printer appropriately on a computer. Many printers also have calibration software to ensure that your printer is printing with proper alignment and colors. Printer calibration should occur after changing ink cartridges. Once the printer is completely configured and tested, you should explain the basic printer functionality to Beth. You do not need to assign print permissions to a user to ensure that the inkjet printer is working properly. The scenario does not suggest that the printer is to be shared by everyone. Therefore, this is not a valid option. You do not need to assign print permissions to Beth to ensure that the inkjet printer is working properly. By default, the printing permissions will be assigned to Beth after the printer has been configured if Beth is logged on when the printer is installed. You do not need to load the device drivers for the inkjet printer as the first step toward ensuring that the inkjet printer is working properly. The scenario states that the printer is installed and configured on Beth's desktop. Therefore, the device drivers for the printer are already installed. If Beth's computer is running Windows 7 or above, and no local printer is readily available, you can print any document virtually by printing to a file, portable document format (PDF), XPS Document Writer, or image.

The group has a central office, where all the medical records will be stored electronically, and several satellite offices around the city. Storage procedures must follow HIPAA guidelines. The satellite offices will have computers in the administrative areas as well as the examination rooms. Which type of system should you install in the examination rooms?",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "c. Thin Client"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should install thin clients in the examination rooms. The computers there will not store any data, but rather serve as a means to collect patient data. The data will be stored on the server at the central office. Because the exam-room computers do not need extensive functionality or an array of productivity applications, thin clients would be sufficient. Thin client computers typically have limited functionality, and they may not even have an operating system. Thick client computers can have an extensive set of applications, and would allow the user to perform operations that a thin client would not. In addition, thick clients perform the majority of their operations on the local client machine instead of on the server. If you installed thick clients in the examination rooms, data would be stored on those machines. If the machines were ever stolen, then the data could be compromised, which is a violation of HIPAA regulations. Servers would not be the best choice for the examination room. Servers should be installed at the central office, where all the records are stored electronically. Tablets may not be the most secure option. They can easily be left in the examination room and forgotten by the nurse, doctor, or medical assistant. It would be an easy matter for the patient to walk out with a tablet that was left behind."

The organization handles a lot of confidential and highly sensitive data that must be kept secure, even when performing a transfer between units inside the same office. You need to ensure that your cloud deployment is set up so all file transfers use a fully encrypted protocol. Which protocol should you use?",

      "d. FTPS"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. FTPS"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should use File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS). FTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt the file during transfer. It is the easier of the two secure versions of FTP to use because it uses existing FTP commands. The other secure version of FTP is SFTP, which uses SSH commands. You should not use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) because it is used for secure Internet access to web servers, not to transfer files. You should not use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) because it is not a secure protocol. FTP transmits information in cleartext, meaning the contents of the file are readable. You should not use Secure Shell (SSH) because it is a protocol for connecting to network devices via the command line, not a file transfer protocol. However, you can combine SSH with FTP to create the file transfer protocol Secure FTP (SFTP). SFTP is considered more secure than FTPS, but it is harder to use because it uses SSH commands rather than FTP commands. SFTP provides a secure protocol for the transfer of files through a client-server architecture. SFTP is not FTP running on SSH, but a new protocol in itself. It provides for operations on remote files, making it similar to a remote file system protocol. There are various network components that comprise the networking inside of a cloud deployment. These include ports, protocols, addressing, intrusion detection, and demilitarized zones. To pass the exam, you need to be familiar with these common network port and protocol considerations when extending to the cloud."

It also provides power to older CD/DVD drives, hard drives, PCI cards, and Pentium III and earlier processors. The +3.3 voltage provides power to certain video cards and the motherboard. However, it has nothing to do with the Power Good signal. The -5 voltage provides power to the ISA or AT bus adapter cards. The -12 voltage provides power to some older network adapters and serial ports. The +12 voltage provides power to newer CD/DVD drives, hard drives, and Pentium 4 and Athlon processors.

      "c. Thunderbolt"
    ],
    "explanation": "Thunderbolt-3 cables can provide the bandwidth to support 4K monitors, up to 40 Gbps. Thunderbolt-3 includes a USB-C connection. Including this connection allows the cable to be used with other USB-C compatible devices. Thunderbolt also allows 'daisy-chaining' devices, making it an ideal choice for video display walls that use multiple monitors. Although Thunderbolt cables were developed by Apple, many Windows computers have Thunderbolt-compatible ports. The Lightning cable replaced Apple's 30-pin charging cable in 2012. It is used to recharge iPhones beginning with the iPhone 5, and is still used with the latest generation of iPhone devices. The cable has the charging connector on one end, and a standard USB-A connector on the opposite end. The USB connector provides the associated device the flexibility to connect with anything that has a USB port. Lighting cables transfer at USB 3.0 speeds of 5 Gbps and feature an 8-pin connector that can be inserted in either direction (meaning there is no top or bottom to this connector). Lightning cables are proprietary to Apple devices. Universal Serial Bus (USB) cables were introduced in the late 1990s as replacements for parallel and serial connections. USB has gone through several evolutions, the most recent version being USB 3.1/USB-C. Each new version has provided improvements in data transfer speeds. The USB types and their associated transfer rates are as follows: USB 1.0 – 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) USB 1.1 – 12 Mbps USB 2.0 – 480 Mbps USB 3.0 – 5 gigabits per second (Gbps) USB 3.1 – 10 Gbps Serial cables typically have DB9 connections and are considered legacy ports. They are primarily used to configure routers and switches in lieu of an Ethernet connection. Serial cables have a maximum transfer rate of 115.2 kilobits per second, making them unsuitable for high-speed video transfer."

    "question": "You need to upgrade your Windows computer to the latest Windows edition from a master boot image. You put a DVD that contains the files for the new edition into the DVD drive and reboot the system. The system does not boot from the DVD. What should you do first to solve this problem?",
    "options": [
      "a. Configure UEFI to boot from the DVD drive.",
      "b. Make sure the DVD drive is set to master.",
      "c. Change the disk format from ISO 9660 to Joliet.",
      "d. Replace the DVD drive."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Configure UEFI to boot from the DVD drive."
    ],
    "explanation": "You can set the order in which the system looks for a boot image. By default, the UEFI in most computers looks for a boot manager first, then for the USB drive, then for the CD or DVD drive, and finally for a network adapter, before reporting the error that it does not find a boot image. If you want to boot from a DVD drive, you should tell UEFI to search the DVD drive for a boot image. In this case, the boot manager would be found on the local drive so other options would not be accessed. To ensure that the system would boot to the DVD drive, the DVD drive would need to be the first boot option in UEFI. You should not replace the DVD drive as your first step. The DVD drive could be defective, but it is much more likely that the UEFI is not configured to first search the DVD drive for a boot record. Also, it will take approximately 30 seconds to restart the computer and check UEFI, whereas it would take several minutes to replace the DVD drive, provided you have one handy. As a general troubleshooting rule, you should try the quick fixes before resorting to the more time-consuming troubleshooting tasks. You should not ensure that the DVD drive is set to master. The main function of the master/slave setting is to tell each drive on the IDE channel that another drive is present. It does not affect whether the system can boot from the drive. You should not change the disk format from ISO 9660 to Joliet format. The Joliet format is for long file name CDs, and this format cannot be used to boot. Another common DVD problem occurs when a DVD drive has trouble reading a DVD. This is often caused when the appropriate decoder software is not installed. When a computer attempts to boot to incorrect device, the issue is usually related to the UEFI boot order. It was more common when floppy drives were listed as the first boot device. If a non-bootable floppy were left in the floppy drive at boot time, the computer would display a non-system disk or disk error at startup. Once the floppy disk was removed from the drive, the computer would boot. You can change the boot order in the UEFI. This issue can also result from missing or corrupt boot files. If you suspect that this error is due to boot files being missing or corrupt, you should enable boot logging and replace the missing or corrupt boot files using the Windows installation files."

    "explanation": "You should connect the printer to the print server using 802.11g. This will provide a connection that operates at 54 megabits per second (Mbps). Other wireless network options include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax. 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz radio spectrum and supports up to 54 Mbps (actual throughput is closer to 22 Mbps). 802.11b operates in the 2.4 GHz radio spectrum and supports up to 11 Mbps. 802.11g operates in the 2.4 GHz radio spectrum and supports up to 54 Mbps. 802.11n operates in the 2.4 or 5 GHz radio spectrum and supports up to 600 Mbps. 802.11ac (WiFi 5) operates in the 5.0 GHz range and supports up to 1.3 Gbps. 802.11ax (WiFi 6) operates in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or 6 GHz radio spectrums, and supports up to 9.6 Gbps (actual throughput is closer to 600 Mbps). You should not connect the printer to the print server using Bluetooth 2.1. This connection would only operate at 3 Mbps. You should not connect the printer to the print server using Infrared. Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is a wireless protocol that operates up to 4 Mbps. It requires line-of-sight communications and will only operate if the two devices are within 1 meter of each other. You should not purchase a NIC for the printer and connect the printer to the print server over the network. This would require an additional amount of money to be spent. Also, the Ethernet network only operates at 10 Mbps, which is much slower than the 802.11g network."

    "correct_answer": [
      "d. QoS"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should configure the Quality of Service (QoS) settings, which allows you to prioritize different types of traffic. QoS essentially allocates bandwidth based on a priority number assigned to the type of traffic. In this instance, Skype traffic would be given a higher priority over other types of traffic, such as general Internet browsing. QoS is typically configured on the router or wireless access point. Configuring encryption would provide enhanced security, but would not resolve the Skype for Business issue. Most wireless access points are configured with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) by default. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA version 2 (WPA2) provide better security than WEP, which is effectively useless. Configuring channels would not solve the issue. The users are in the 5 GHz network, and only 2.4 GHz wireless uses channels. Whenever configuring wireless channels, you must always take into account any applicable rules and regulations. Depending on your location by state or by country, different rules and regulations will apply, and you need to be aware of them to avoid any fines or legal trouble. For instance, some governments may regulate the maximum power output allowed on networks or the specific channels you are allowed to use.

    "correct_answer": [
      "d. DNS"
    ],
    "explanation": "Domain Name System (DNS) is not an Internet appliance. It provides a mapping of IP addresses to domain names. It is analogous to an address book or a telephone directory. Internet appliances, according to the CompTIA A+ exam guide, include UTM, IDS, spam gateways, load balancers, proxy servers, and IPS devices. Unified Threat Management (UTM) devices are Internet appliances. They provide a single point on the network from which multiple security functions are managed. This single point of presence is in contrast to several independent software and devices, such as antivirus, antispam, firewall, IDS, and IPS. Spam gateways are installed behind a firewall and examine all incoming mail to filter out email that is likely to be fraudulent or a phishing email. These gateways can help minimize the risks that spam can pose to organizations. Load balancers are a used by organizations to ensure that servers do not become overburdened from their workload and go down, causing loss of availability. Multiple servers participate in a load-balanced solution, thereby distributing the load. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service. The proxy server may exist in a firewall server or on a separate server, which forwards requests through the firewall. A proxy server caches web data and images. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an Internet appliance. It typically sits outside the network and watches packets coming through the network and sets off an alarm if a packet (or series of packets) contains something that violates a defined set of rules. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an Internet appliance that sits inline in the network. While it performs many of the same duties as an IDS, an IPS also prevents the offending traffic instead of just detecting it."

    ],
    "explanation": "You should put on an antistatic wrist strap after unplugging the AC adapter and removing the battery from the laptop. You should take this precaution while servicing or upgrading a computer system to prevent damage of sensitive computer components. Computer memory is extremely sensitive to static electricity. Therefore, you should always ground yourself before handling and installing the memory, and you can wear an antistatic wrist strap to do so. If you do not have an antistatic wrist strap, you can ground yourself by installing memory on an uncarpeted surface and by touching an unpainted metal part of your laptop. You should always unplug the AC adapter and remove the battery from the laptop before you begin servicing or upgrading the laptop. This will ensure that the laptop does not receive power during servicing or upgrade and will prevent the laptop components from being damaged. You should not remove the memory at this point in the process. Computer memory is extremely sensitive to static electricity. Therefore, you should always ground yourself before handling and installing the memory. You should not remove the CMOS battery. The CMOS battery provides power to the CMOS chip to ensure that the CMOS settings are not lost when the computer is switched off. In this scenario, you want to upgrade memory on a laptop. Therefore, removing the CMOS battery is not required. You should not disconnect the power supply from the motherboard. Laptops use an AC adapter or a battery as a source of power. Separate power supplies are found in desktop computers. In this scenario, you have already unplugged the AC adapter and removed the battery from the laptop. This will ensure that the laptop does not receive power during the upgrade. When upgrading memory in a laptop, you are usually limited to two memory slots. If you discover that both slots are filled, the only way to upgrade the memory is to completely replace the existing memory."

    "explanation": "A pointer (PTR) record maps an IP address to a hostname. A host or address (A) record maps a hostname to an IPv4 address. An AAAA record maps a hostname to an IPv6 address. A mail exchange (MX) record maps a domain name to an e-mail server. A canonical name (CNAME) record contains an alias for an existing A record. A start of authority (SOA) record contains information regarding a particular DNS zone's start of authority. A Domain Name System (DNS) server is the authority for a DNS zone, which contains DNS records. DNS servers allow users to request access to devices using either the devices' hostname or IP address. A DNS server stores fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to IP address mappings. This server allows clients to use the easier-to-remember FQDNs to access remote devices. Dynamic DNS is an implementation of DNS that allows real-time updates to DNS records. With Dynamic DNS (DDNS), devices can automatically update their DNS records or allow a DHCP server to implement the updates on behalf of the DNS client. Text (TXT) records contain human-readable text and are designed to help with fraudulent phishing emails by filtering out emails that are spoofed. Within TXT records, there are three important components that help with spam management. The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) validates that an email sent from a domain was authorized by the owner of the domain. The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) looks at the addresses of the last SMTP server and verifies that the IP address and SMTP server match to detect spoofing attacks. Lastly, the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) system is used to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use to prevent spoofing attacks."

    ],
    "explanation": "Universal Serial Bus (USB) 3.0 has a data transfer capacity of 5 gigabits per second (Gbps) and was introduced in late 2008. The connector and ports are typically blue. USB 3.1 was introduced as an improvement to USB 3.0 and has a capacity of 10 Gbps. USB 3.1 connectors and ports are typically a teal color. USB, also known as USB 1.1, has a data transfer capacity of 12 megabits per second (Mbps). USB cables were introduced in the late 1990s as replacements for parallel and serial connections. USB has gone through several evolutions, the most recent version being USB-C. Each new version has provided improvements in data transfer speeds. USB-C uses a smaller connector instead of the 'universal' flat and wide Type A connector. USB-C is an implementation of USB 3.1, which is capable of data transfer rates of up to 10 Gbps. USB 2.0 has a data transfer capacity of 480 Mbps in high-speed mode. USB 2.0 was introduced in early 2000, and is backwards-compatible with USB 1.1."

      "a. Disable SSID broadcast",
      "b. MAC filtering",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. MAC filtering",
      "a. Disable SSID broadcast"
    ],
    "explanation": "Media Access Control (MAC) filtering is a way to increase security in a wireless network. With this filtering, the MAC address of each network interface card (NIC) that attempts to connect to the network is checked. Only MAC addresses that are specifically allowed to connect are granted connection. When configuring MAC filtering, you should set up an access control list (ACL). MAC filtering is configured on the wireless access point or wireless router. A service set identifier (SSID) broadcast actually decreases security in a wireless network. If the SSID is broadcast, any wireless NICs in the proximity can locate the network. If you disable SSID broadcast, you increase the security of your network, and users will have to type in the SSID to connect to the network. War driving is a technique used to discover wireless networks. Once intruders locate your wireless network, they attempt to hack into your system. Rogue access points are wireless access points that have been connected to your network without authorization. This decreases the security of your network."

You want to determine whether a WAN link between Wkst1 and www.cybervista.net is down. You know that data normally passes through 10 hops in transit from Wkst1 to www.ecollege.ie. Which command should you use to test connectivity?",
    "options": [
      "a. nbtstat www.ecollege.ie",
      "b. ipconfig www.ecollege.ie",
      "c. tracert www.ecollege.ie",
      "d. arp www.ecollege.ie"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "c. tracert www.ecollege.ie"
    ],
    "explanation": "Of the listed commands, you should use the tracert www.ecollege.ie command to determine whether a WAN link between Wkst1 and www.ecollege.ie is broken. The tracert computername command or tracert IP-Address command starts the tracert utility. The tracert utility displays the path that data travels through a network. The path begins at the host, which is the computer on which the utility is started, and ends at the host specified in the computername or IP-Address variables. In this scenario, the tracert www.ecollege.ie command will display the route that data travels between Wkst1 and www.cybervista.net. Each host that data traverses on its route to the destination host is referred to as a hop. The tracert utility numbers each hop and displays the following information for each hop: time required for the data to travel through the host, the FQDN of the host, and the IP address of the host. You can use the tracert command to determine which WAN link is causing a connectivity problem. In this scenario, for example, you know that data usually passes through 10 hops from Wkst1 to www.cybervista.net. If the tracert utility reports an error transmitting data from hop 7 to hop 8, then a problem likely exists with the WAN link between hop 7 and hop 8. You can use the arp command with various switches to determine the status of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) on a computer and to view the ARP cache. ARP is the protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite that resolves media access control (MAC) addresses to IP addresses. Each NIC in a computer is configured with a MAC address, which is used for physical addressing on a network. If you issue the arp www.cybervista.net command at a command prompt on a Windows computer, then a new command prompt will be displayed. You will not be able to view the route that data travels between the Wkst1 computer and the www.cybervista.net computer. You can use the nbtstat command to view information about the status of NetBIOS over TCP/IP on a Microsoft network and to troubleshoot problems with Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). WINS resolves NetBIOS names to IP address on Microsoft networks. If you issue the nbtstat www.ecollege.ie command at a command prompt, then a screen of instructions for the use of the nbtstat command will be displayed. You can issue the ipconfig command at a command prompt on a Windows computer to view the IP configuration, including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway address. If you issue the ipconfig www.ecollege.ie command at a command prompt, an error will occur."

    "explanation": "If you are unable to access a website using its FQDN, but you can browse the same website using its IP address, then the Domain Name System (DNS) server for the website is down. A DNS server provides name resolution over the Internet and allows you to use an FQDN instead of an IP address. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is responsible for assigning IP addresses to DHCP clients. It does not allow you to access a website using its FQDN. A DHCP scope allows the DHCP server to assign IP addresses to clients. It also enables you to balance the server loads between multiple DHCP servers. The DHCP scope does not determine whether you can access a website using its FQDN or IP address. If the company's website had been down, it would not have been accessible using either its FQDN or its IP address."

    "explanation": "To ensure that the problem is with the internal keyboard, you should plug in an external keyboard. If the external keyboard works, you can then proceed to checking the internal keyboard connections and settings. Often, when a user disconnects the laptop from a docking station, the internal keyboard may not work because the user has never used the laptop away from the docking station. Cleaning the keyboard is not the next step. You first need to determine that the keyboard is the problem by connecting an external keyboard. If you determine that the internal keyboard is the problem, it is most likely that cleaning the keyboard will not fix the problem. Once components have failed, simply cleaning the component does not usually fix the problem. Enabling the keyboard is not the next step. You first need to determine that the keyboard is the problem by connecting an external keyboard. You should not replace the internal keyboard until you have first ensured that the keyboard is the problem and checked all the keyboard's connections and settings. Dust accumulation can cause keys to stick. In addition, most keys have a spring that can wear out. First, you should try to blow out the keyboard using compressed air. It may also be necessary to clean the individual keys. In some laptops, keys can be detached for individual cleaning. Be careful when detaching individual keys because this can damage keyboard components. If this does not fix the problem, replace the integrated keyboard or purchase an external keyboard. Spilled liquids are most often the cause of sticking keys."

All of the other statements are security implications of implementing a private cloud, not a public cloud. Security issues are the sole responsibility of your company's personnel for a private cloud. Public cloud deployments share the responsibility between the cloud provider's personnel and organizational personnel, depending on the guidelines set out in the service level agreement (SLA) and other contracts. The local ISP and power grid can impact the availability of resources stored on the cloud for a private cloud. The local outage would affect any attempt to access the data. Whereas a local outage might affect cloud access from that location, but personnel could go to an alternate location or might could access the data via other means, such as via using a mobile device's hotspot.

The following exhibit shows the four most used fiber optic connectors: An AUI connector is a 15-pin female connector that looks similar to the shape of the letter D. It is also known as a DB-15 or Digital Intel Xerox (DIX) connector. It is typically a component of thick Ethernet (10Base5) connections, though it is being phased out with the introduction of Fast Ethernet. An RJ-11 connector is typically used to connect two pairs of UTP wiring to a voice-grade telephone system. RJ-45 connectors are used to connect unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable to hubs, switches, bridges, routers, network interface cards (NICs), and various other twisted-pair networking devices. RJ-45 connectors are shaped like RJ-11 connectors, only larger. They use an 8-pin connector housing eight (four pairs) wires. Registered Jack (RJ) connectors use a small tab to lock the connector in place. The following exhibit shows an RJ-11 connector and an RJ-45 connector: Coaxial cables generally use either Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) or Threaded Neill-Concelman (TNC) connectors. They can also use F type connectors. The F connector is a connector commonly used for cable television and for satellite television and cable modems. BNC connectors are shown in the following exhibit: The TNC connectors are shown in the following exhibit: The F connectors are shown in the following exhibit: A punchdown block is listed as a type of connector. A punchdown block is used when an organization needs to run wires long distances, typically between distribution points or communication closets. They are used because they are simpler than RJ-45 jacks, less prone to breaking, and do not introduce much, if any, extraneous electrical interference to the wire."

    "explanation": "You can use either the 802.11a or the 802.11g specifications. Both 802.11a and 802.11g provide data throughput of 54 megabits per second (Mbps). The 802.11g wireless network standard provides backward compatibility with the 802.11b wireless network specification, but the 802.11a network specification does not provide backward compatibility to any other wireless network because it operates in the 5 GHz frequency range rather than the 2.4 GHz range that 802.11b and 802.1g operate in. You should not use the 802.11b wireless network specification. The 802.11b network specification provides data throughput of only 11 Mbps. You should not use the 802.11 wireless network specification. The 802.11 provides data throughput of only 2 Mbps. The 802.11n wireless standard uses the 2.4 or 5.0 GHz range and is reported to be capable of up to 600 Mbps. However, 300 to 400 Mbps is usually the maximum in most of today's deployments. The 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) wireless standard uses the 5.0 GHz range. It is reported as capable of up to 1.3 Gbps. Because it uses channel bonding to provide increased speed, fewer channels are available on this standard. To remain backwards compatible with 802.11n, 802.11ac wireless routers include protocol support for the 2.4 GHz band. When operating at 2.4 GHz, they provide speeds up to 450 Mbps.

    "explanation": "You should edit the size of the paging file in the operating system. In many Windows versions, you can accomplish this by clicking the Settings button in the Performance section of the System Properties dialog box's Advanced tab. Virtual memory is managed by the operating system. The initial size and maximum size of the paging file can be manually configured by the user. The paging file is virtual memory. You should not open the case and verify the type of RAM installed. This is a necessary step when upgrading RAM because the Windows operating system can tell you the amount of memory installed, but not the type of memory installed. The only way to discover this is by physically inspecting the RAM chips. Upgrading the RAM will not increase the amount of virtual memory. However, increasing the amount of RAM in your system can often decrease the need for virtual memory. You cannot edit the size of the paging file in the CMOS. Virtual memory is not managed or configured in the CMOS. You should not restart the computer. This will reset the paging file so that the virtual memory problem goes away temporarily. However, it does not increase the size of the virtual memory file. Sluggish performance can be caused by a variety of different issues. If you notice performance is abnormally slow, try updating device drivers, expanding the available RAM, checking the integrity/updating operating system files, and closing background applications. Sluggish performance can also indicate a hard drive failure, fragmented data, or a malware infection."

    "options": [
      "a. Output capacity in watts",
      "b. Voltage levels",
      "c. Form factor",
      "d. Fan type"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "a. Output capacity in watts",
      "c. Form factor"
    ],
    "explanation": "When replacing a power supply, you should first look for a replacement that fits the form factor of the computer. Power supplies are designed to operate with specific form factors, such as ATX and ATX12V v1.x that connect to the motherboard with a 20-pin version connector. The ATX12V v2.x and micro ATX all use the standard 24-pin connector. Once you have found the proper form factor, the next characteristic that you should look for is the rated output capacity in watts. You must make sure that the replacement can supply sufficient power for the components inside the computer. You should estimate the wattage consumed by the computer's components and then install a power supply that is rated higher than your estimate. This allows components to be added to the computer and gives a buffer for estimating errors. You do not need to consider voltage levels or fan type, because the voltage and fan type sizes are standard within the form factors. If a replacement ATX power supply unit has a connector that is too large for the motherboard's socket, you need a 24-to-20 pin ATX adapter. In addition, you may need to upgrade from a 200-watt power supply to a 400-watt ATX power supply. This would result in the addition of 3.3 volts of power to the computer. The needs of the computer should be determined before purchasing the power supply, as the needs can often determine the size the power supply should be. Mini-ATX and micro-ATX power supplies are smaller than standard ATX power supplies. They are designed for smaller computer cases. If you must replace a proprietary power supply unit, you will be limited to purchasing the same power supply made specifically for the computer. When selecting a power supply, you must decide your input needs: input 115V vs. 220V. You must determine the wattage rating needed based on the number of devices/types of devices to be powered. A wattage rating is an expression of the maximum power that a device can safely continuously handle. The three types of output for a power supply are 3.3V, 5.5V, and 12V. Motherboards include a 20-pin to 24-pin motherboard adapter to which the power supply connects. Power supplies also come in a modular and redundant form. A modular power supply is an electronic power system that can have all its power cables and connectors be detached and removed, whereas other powers supply systems are permanently hard-wired. A redundant power supply is a power supply unit that has two or more power supply units inside it. These are often found in servers or other high-end computers."

    "question": "A user is not able to access shared folders on the network. While troubleshooting the problem, the technician first checks for the link lights on the Network Interface Card (NIC). The technician observes that the link lights are not on or blinking on the NIC. Which actions should the technician perform to resolve the problem by using the least amount of administrative effort? (Choose two.)",
    "options": [
      "a. Replace the NIC.",
      "b. Replace the network cable.",
      "c. Run the ipconfig /flushdns command.",
      "d. Run the ipconfig /release command.",
      "e. Check that the switch is on and the other end of the cable is connected to the switch."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Replace the network cable.",
      "e. Check that the switch is on and the other end of the cable is connected to the switch."
    ],
    "explanation": "To resolve the problem by using the least amount of administrative effort, the technician should check that the switch is on and the other end of the network cable is connected to the switch. If the switch is not on, or if the other end of the network cable is not connected to the switch, the user's computer will not be connected to the network. Therefore, the technician should check these areas first. If the problem persists, the technician must try replacing the network cable to resolve the problem because faulty cables can cause network problems. Therefore, while troubleshooting network problems, you should check if the network cable is properly functioning. The number one A+ rule for connectivity issues is always to check the connection. The ipconfig /release command is not used for troubleshooting NIC problems. The ipconfig /release command is used to release the IP address for network adapters. Before running this command, you must run the ipconfig /renew command to renew the IP address. Replacing the NIC might solve the problem in this scenario. However, replacing NIC involves more administrative effort and time than checking the switch and network cable. Therefore, you should not replace the NIC as your first troubleshooting step. The ipconfig /flushdns command is not used for troubleshooting NIC problems. The ipconfig /flushdns command is used to clear the Domain Naming Service (DNS) client cache. If the amber light is constantly flashing on a NIC card, collisions are occurring. A flashing green light indicates normal activity. If the lights do not flash, a failure at the data link level has occurred. If the indicator lights on a network switch are flashing, either the port on the switch or the NIC of the computer to which the switch is connected is faulty."

    "options": [
      "a. Types of data to be synchronized",
      "b. Synchronization to the cloud",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "c. Software requirements to install the application on the PC"
    ],
    "explanation": "Your primary concern should be the software requirements to install the application on the PC. The requirements will vary with the application and the operating system. In this scenario, you may have some older hardware because you are using a refurbished computer. Apple devices have the capability to synchronize wirelessly through iCloud. Android devices have the same capability with Google Drive. There are a number of third-party cloud storage solutions that allow for cloud synchronization, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, and Box. However, in this situation, you want to synchronize with a PC, not the cloud. Data stored on mobile devices includes contacts, applications, email, pictures, music, videos, calendar, bookmarks, documents, location data, social media data, e-books, and passwords. When synchronizing data, most applications will allow you to select which types of data to synchronize. The more data you include, the longer the synchronization will take to complete. However, it does not really affect the location where you store the data unless you do not have enough storage space remaining. Mobile devices are usually synchronized to a PC over a direct connection via a USB cable. Because they are not transmitting wirelessly or over the Internet, you do not have to worry about cellular carrier data caps. If you have configured your mobile device to synchronize to the cloud and you do not have an unlimited cellular data plan, you should configure the device to perform background synchronization only when you are connected to a trusted Wi-Fi network. This will prevent you from incurring carrier charges for data overage. If your computer was connected to the Internet through a cellular (4G or 5G) network, as with a mobile hotspot or wireless wide area network (WWAN), you would need to worry about data caps. Windows computers allow you to configure a connection as a metered connection, which lowers bandwidth usage by limiting certain activities (such as syncing online files to the PC or downloading OS updates). You can also set a data usage limit on your connection that will warn you when you are reaching your cap. As of this writing, Mac computers rely on third-party applications for this capability."

    "options": [
      "a. Enable port triggering.",
      "b. Enable port forwarding.",
      "c. Enable NAT.",
      "d. Enable QoS."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Enable port forwarding."
    ],
    "explanation": "You should enable port forwarding. Port forwarding allows you to enable a specific port in the firewall and direct traffic that comes from outside your network to a specific IP address. For example, in this scenario, you would open port 80 on the firewall and configure port forwarding to forward all incoming traffic to the web server. You should not enable port triggering. Port triggering allows you to open an incoming connection to one computer based on an outgoing connection. You should not enable Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT causes your entire network to appear as a single entity on the Internet. Static NAT uses a 1-to-1 mapping between addresses on each side of a NAT device. In dynamic NAT (DNAT), the mapping of IP addresses can change. In both cases, only the IP addresses in the packets are changed. The NAT device must keep track of the IP mappings as they are assigned. You should not enable Quality of Service (QoS). QoS allows you to limit the bandwidth available for data based on the protocol used, the IP address, or other parameters. It is usually configured on routers."

    "explanation": "The Master Boot Record (MBR) is contained in a partition's master boot sector, which is the first sector of a computer's hard disk or a system floppy disk. MBRs contain two primary components: executable code and a partition table. Executable code in the MBR is responsible for locating the appropriate operating system from the partition table and loading it into RAM to make the operating system active. Partition tables identify each partition that resides on a specific disk. The MBR is usually only 512 bytes, so it only takes up a very small percentage of the hard drive, even on small drives. A computer's MBR is not stored in the basic input/output system (BIOS), the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), or the paging file."

    "options": [
      "a. Power Surges",
      "b. Dust",
      "c. Power Sags",
      "d. Humidity"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Dust"
    ],
    "explanation": "Dust is the most likely cause of desktop computer overheating. Dust buildup can cause cooling fans to fail. For this reason, you should often clean your computer, both inside and out, to ensure that dust accumulation does not occur. All users should be educated on computer cleaning methods to ensure that dust buildup does not occur. Overheating also occurs from cooling fan or cooling system failures. Make sure that all open slots are covered and that all system fans are functional. Laptops may overheat if they are placed on a surface that does not disperse heat (such as the fabric of a sofa or a pillow). Humidity usually does not cause overheating. Low humidity causes electrostatic discharge (ESD) issues. High humidity causes moisture and condensation buildup. Power sags occur when the power level drops dramatically. A power sag usually causes components to fail, not to overheat. Power surges occur when the power level spikes dramatically. A power surge can also cause components to fail. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with built-in surge suppression can protect against power sags and surges. Be alert to the following events that could indicate the computer is overheating or an internal component (such as a fan) is failing: Smoke – This is a horrible problem to have but is usually easy to trace. Shut down the computer immediately and locate the device that is producing the smoke. Replace that device. Burning smell – This problem usually accompanies smoke. As with smoke, you should shut down the computer immediately and locate the device that is producing the smoke. Replace that device. Grinding noise – Loud noises or grinding noises usually originate from system fans, the power supply, or the hard drives, because very few internal devices have moving parts. While a grinding noise is most often associated with a hard drive failure, it can also come from a broken fan. The noise usually means that the component is close to failure. The CPU and power supply rely on these fans prevent overheating, so you should replace the part immediately. Unexpected shutdowns – Random shutdowns that are not accompanied with a particular error message or a blue screen of death (BSOD) are usually the result of overheating. Make sure that all fans are working effectively. You may also want to deploy additional cooling options. Make sure that all open ports in the computer have a cover. Continuous reboots – Reboots are usually the result of electrical issues, power supply issues, or overheating. Brownouts or blackouts cause computers to reboot. Attaching a computer to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will ensure that you can safely shut down the computer if these occur. If the power supply in the computer is the issue, you should replace it with one that supplies adequate power to the computer. Finally, if overheating is causing the reboots, you should check all fans and ensure that the CPU heat sink is still attached. You may need to replace these or add another cooling device to your computer."

      "a. NFC",
      "b. Zigbee",
      "c. Z-Wave",
      "d. RFID"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "d. RFID"
    ],
    "explanation": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) would most likely be employed in an anti-theft alarm system in a retail store. RFID uses a small chip attached to or embedded in an item and radio waves to monitor the location of the chip and therefore the device. Common applications for RFID include tracking the movement of products through a warehouse, retail theft prevention, and tracking runners during marathon races with RFID chips embedded in their bibs. Near Field Communications (NFC) allows communication between two devices that are very close together. NFC uses the 13.56 MHz radio frequency and is not dependent on Wi-Fi networks or cellular networks, such as 4G. It is often used on smartphones for contactless payments, such as waving your phone over a sensor to pay for a purchase at checkout. An NFC or tap pay device allows the payment information to be transmitted to a computer. Zigbee is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It typically is used in large-scale medical, industrial, and scientific applications. Zigbee operates in the same 2.4 GHz frequency band as Wi-Fi. It creates a mesh network in a similar fashion to Z-Wave, but has a capacity of 64,000 devices. Z-Wave is a technology that creates a wireless mesh network with up to 232 nodes. It is often used small scale in smart home automation, and operates in the 800–900 MHz frequency range. While there is a primary controller or hub, each device on the network communicates with the next closest device, much in the same the way that routers communicate with each other in a high-performance mesh network."

    "correct_answer": [
      "b. Antenna type",
      "a. Regulatory requirements",
      "c. Power considerations",
      "d. Unlicensed or licensed frequencies"
    ],
    "explanation": "You should consider all of these factors when implanting a long-range wireless network. The power requirements for long-range networks that span several kilometers is very intensive and can become expensive to implement. Understanding these requirements is critical as you must ensure that the wireless system has sufficient power to continuously operate without exceeding power draw regulations. Governmental regulations are unavoidable and must be taken into consideration when operating any form of wireless network. Depending on location, there may be a variety of federal, state, and local laws that you will need to comply with. These regulations can dictate which wireless frequencies can be used, how much power a wireless network can draw, and which types of antennas can/cannot be used. Antenna considerations are another important factor. Both antenna placement as well as the type of antennas used can drastically change the effectiveness of your wireless network. A standard wireless antenna only has a range of 30 meters indoors and 100 meters outdoors, whereas a directional antenna can improve the range of a network to many kilometers within line of sight. Different antennas provide different benefits and drawbacks when it comes to coverage, power consumptions, and cost. Wireless devices use radio frequencies to transmit data and communicate over a network. For wireless frequencies, between 300 Megahertz (Mhz) and 6 Gigahertz (GHz) provides the optimal communications for modern data transmissions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has licensed radio frequencies within this range to different users and organizations for a fee for the exclusive right to transmit on their assigned frequency within a geographic area in return for no interference. However, organizations can choose to still use airwaves without consulting the FCC and become unlicensed users. Currently there are very few bands that can be utilized by unlicensed groups, which often results in interference occurring from other unlicensed groups using the same frequencies. Whenever implementing a wireless network, it is important to understand what frequencies you will be using, as licensed ones cost more but provide the best performance, and unlicensed ones cost nothing but are often associated with slow performance."

The physical layer encompasses transmission media such as unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), fiber optic, and so on. The datalink layer deals with transmitting frames on a LAN, so it includes the network interface card (NIC) and switch. Routers operate on OSI layer 3, because they transmit data between networks.

    "explanation": "Developed by Microsoft, the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) allows users to connect to remote computers and run programs on them as if they were sitting at the computer. It uses port 3389. A port is associated with a specific protocol and must be \"opened\" on a router to allow traffic from the program or protocol to enter the LAN. The combination of an IP address and a port is considered a socket. The IP address gets the data to the right destination, and the port number tells the transmission layer of the OSI model which application the data is to be sent to.

Firewalls can protect you in two ways: they protect your network resources from hackers lurking in the dark corners of the Internet, and they can simultaneously prevent computers on your network from accessing undesirable content on the Internet or sending out data that they shouldn't. PoE stands for Power over Ethernet, and EoP stands for Ethernet over Power. Neither has to do with protection. While a router may incorporate a firewall, it is not, by itself, a firewall.

    "explanation": "The default gateway is the address to the network's router on the LAN side of the router. The router allows the host to communicate with hosts who are not on the local network. The default gateway is also called the router's internal address. The ipconfig /all command can be used to see the default gateway address that the local computer is currently configured to use. The router will also have an external address, which is used to communicate with networks outside the LAN. Virtually all modern routers use a process called network address translation (NAT), which will substitute the router's external address for a host's IP address when requesting information from a remote network. The router knows which host requested the information and will pass it on to the correct host when it is received. This is one of the ways that the router protects the local hosts from the outside world."

    "explanation": "Fiber-optic broadband Internet offers fast speeds (often in the 1–2 Gbps range) but is also the most expensive. Cable may have download speeds up to 1 Gbps (typically 10 to 500 Mbps), but upload speeds are typically only around 5 to 50 Mbps, while fiber-optic upload speeds may be in the 1 Gbps range. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) uses plain old telephone service (POTS) lines and is slow. Satellite networks can be faster than DSL, but still only offer speeds up to about 150 Mbps."

      "C. SMB"
    ],
    "explanation": "Server Message Block (SMB) is a protocol used to provide shared access to files, printers, and other network resources. It originally ran on NetBIOS over UDP using ports 137/138 and over TCP using ports 137 and 139, but it's now part of the TCP/IP stack and uses port 445. Running on NetBIOS allows SMB to facilitate file sharing on a single network, while being part of TCP/IP allows it to facilitate file sharing across the Internet. By itself, SMB is not secure, so it needs other network appliances or software to secure the data being sent over its port(s). File Transfer Protocol (FTP) uses ports 20/21, Secure Shell (SSH) uses port 22, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses ports 161/162."

Once upon a time CIFS was used extensively for file sharing over a network, but it has since fallen out of favor. While CIFS and SMB both facilitate file sharing, SMB does it better and has other features as well. Samba and Network File System (NFS) facilitate sharing files between clients and servers in Linux distributions.

      "B. Hub"
    ],
    "explanation": "Hubs were once used extensively in Ethernet networks, but they have fallen out of favor because they have a large disadvantage when compared to switches. A hub forms a single collision domain with all of their ports. On a switch, each port is its own collision domain. A switch keeps a table of its ports and the media access control (MAC) address that can be reached from each port. A switch will only forward a packet to a specific port, whereas a hub will forward a packet to all of its ports indiscriminately. The exception is that a broadcast packet will be sent to all switch ports. Switches are faster and more accurate than hubs and are used almost exclusively as the connectivity device within a local area network (LAN.)"

    "explanation": "Power over Ethernet (PoE) enables placement of equipment in areas that otherwise would not be able to accept it. Only four of the eight wires in twisted pair wiring are used for communication. The power is sent over the wires that are not used in communication. If the devices on both ends don't support PoE, then an injector can be used to add power to the line on the way to its destination. Compatibility is important, and there are limits to the amount of power that can be transmitted this way. Ethernet over Power (EoP) is not in the CompTIA A+ objectives, but it uses special devices to send Ethernet communications over existing wiring such as in a household.

For it to work, the access point and the device it plugs into both need to support PoE. Further, both the access point and device need to be compatible with each other. EoP, while not on the current A+ objectives, is a technology that allows the user to transmit Ethernet signals over existing power lines. This can be useful in a place where running Ethernet wires is impossible, but more often Wi-Fi is used in those situations instead.

    "correct_answer": [
      "A. /19"
    ],
    "explanation": "A subnet mask of 255.255.224.0 has 8 bits in each of the first 2 octets set to on, and it has 3 bits in the third octet on. Therefore, it corresponds to /19 in shorthand. In the binary number system (base two), each bit has two possible values, 0 or 1. Each bit in an octet going from right to left increments by an exponent of two, making the bits of the octets worth the decimal values as follows: | 128 |64 |32 |16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |. Bits for the subnet mask are always used from left to right, so one bit would be equal to a decimal value of 128. Two bits would be equal to a decimal value of 192 (128 + 64). Three bits would be equal to a decimal value of 224 (128 + 64 + 32), and so on. When all 8 bits of the octet are used for the subnet mask, the equivalent decimal value is 255. For this example, the first 2 octets (8 bits each) are completely on, and in the third octet, only 3 bits are on, making a total of 19 bits in the subnet mask turned on to indicate the network number (8 + 8 + 3 = 19)."

    ],
    "explanation": "No two nodes on any network, whether IPv4 or IPv6, can have the same IP address because the host portion (or interface ID) of the IP address is what identifies the individual computer on the network. If the network has some machines manually configured, which is generally done with servers, and the remainder of the computers are configured to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), you would need to ensure that the manually configured numbers are outside of the DHCP scope (the numbers the DHCP server will automatically assign) but within the bounds of the network. For example, in an IPv4 network, if the network number is 200.100.1.0, the router, which is also acting as a default gateway, might be assigned 200.100.1.1, and numbers from 200.100.1.2 through 200.100.1.20 could be reserved for static configuration on devices that need an IP address that does not change. The DHCP scope would need to not include those numbers. If the network needed an available 180 IP addresses, then 200.100.1.21 to 200.100.1.200 could be safely assigned to the DHCP scope, avoiding any IP address duplication."

    "explanation": "Certain devices on a network, such as printers and servers, should have an IP address that doesn't change (static) so that the other nodes on the network can always find the device. Option A is incorrect because if the DHCP lease on the IP address expires, the print server would be assigned a different IP address the next time it logs in. A static IP could be configured on the printer server, or the IP address could be configured as reserved on the DHCP server for that print server. Either choice would work.

    "explanation": "Near-field communication (NFC) requires devices to be within about 10 centimeters of each other to transmit data. In this case, the devices are working in card emulation mode, but NFC can also be used to transmit between two like devices, such as two cell phones, or to read a smart tag. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is another technology that uses radio waves to transfer information. Wi-Fi is 802.11-based wireless networking, and hardware-assisted virtualization (HAV) is virtualization that allows the virtual machine (VM) more direct access to the physical processor's capabilities."

    "explanation": "Radio frequency identification (RFID) can be implemented to detect and read a 'passive' (no power) tag that is essentially an antenna as it passes within a few feet in range. RFID tags are often used in industry and retail for inventory tracking. The distance for RFID implementation depends on the size and polarization of the antenna, and the frequency and power used, among other features. NFC requires a distance of only a few centimeters. Wi-Fi is 802.11-based wireless networking. Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a nuisance that can disrupt network communications."

    "explanation": "The third octet's subnet mask of 192 means that the first 2 bits of the octet are used to identify the network number, so the network can be broken down into four subnets using those first 2 bits of the octet. The subnets would be 00000000, 01000000, 10000000, and 11000000. IP addresses within each range would be 0 to 63, 64 to 127, 128 to 191, and 192 to 255. The first and last IP in each range would not be used because they would represent the subnet itself and the broadcast numbers. Options A, C, and D all fall in the second subnet's range. Option B is in the third subnet."

    "explanation": "The PoE standards are IEEE 802.3af (PoE), 802.3at (PoE+), and 802.3bt (PoE++). A main difference between the standards is how much power per port can be provided. 802.3af can supply up to 15.4 watts per port, 802.3at can provide up to 30 watts per port, and 802.3bt can provide 60 watts (Type 3) or 100 watts (Type 4). The power that actually reaches the devices is less due to voltage loss over distance. 802.3b is a legacy broadband Ethernet standard. 802.11 and802.11ax are Wi-Fi standards."

    "explanation": "When an IP address and subnet mask are converted to the binary numbers that the computer sees, wherever there is a 1 in the subnet mask, that tells the computer that the corresponding bit in the IP address is part of the network number. Wherever there is a 0 in the subnet mask, the corresponding bit in the IP address is part of the host number. The address in the question, 192.168.2.200/24, is a Class C private address, where, in the subnet mask, the first three octets (24 bits) are all 1s, and the last octet (8 bits) are 0s. So, the first three decimal numbers of the IP address, which is expressed in dotted decimal notation, are the network number, (192.168.2) and the last octet (.200) is the host (individual computer) address.

In a SOHO where there are few new users, the lease time could be longer, but in a restaurant where many people come and go each hour, the DHCP scope might not have enough addresses to accommodate that many users. Setting the lease time to a shorter duration will release the IP address and make it available for a new user. MAC address filtering only allows connection from computers with specific MAC addresses and would greatly limit connectivity. Port forwarding sends traffic for a specific port to a specified computer on the network. The SSID is the wireless network name and can be broadcast so that it is easily found, or it can be hidden."

    "explanation": "This is an IPv6 address. It is 128 bits long, and the last 64 bits are the interface ID, which identifies the individual computer. Since there are eight groups of hex numbers, that means the rightmost four groups are the interface ID. Any leading zeros in an IPv6 address can be omitted, and the :: can be used once in an address to replace consecutive groups of all zeros, so the number in the question fully expanded would be 2001:0000:0000:0000:01a3:0f1a:0308:0833. The interface ID is therefore 1a3:f1a:308:833. The leftmost three sections identify the network, and the fourth identifies the subnet.

In some areas of the world, where there is little or no wired infrastructure, WISPs are the only way that people can get Internet connectivity. A WISP connects to the Internet using either leased lines or microwaves, generally uses point-to-point microwaves between its towers, and uses point-to-multipoint connections between the final tower and users.

Unfortunately, when you pick up the cardstock from the laser printer's output tray, the printed image smears across the paper. Attempting to troubleshoot this problem, you decide to print another sign using regular printer paper and determine that the image does not smear when touched on the regular printer paper. Which of the following would be the NEXT step to perform in your troubleshooting efforts?",
    "options": [
      "Clean the printer's transfer roller",
      "Change the feed rate of the paper",
      "Replace the toner cartridge in the printer",
      "Increase the temperature of the fuser element"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Increase the temperature of the fuser element"
    ],
    "explanation": "When printing with a laser printer, the paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to 801°F (427°C) and pressure are used to bond the toner to the paper permanently. If you often print with specialty paper (i.e., envelopes, cardstock, & labels), you may want to turn up the fuser temperature on your printer. With thicker paper types, heat does not transfer as easily as it does with standard paper so the toner may not bond as well and the image could smear when it is touched."

    "explanation": "A privacy screen is a filter placed on a monitor to decrease the viewing angle of a monitor. This prevents the monitor from being viewed from the side and can help prevent shoulder surfing. The standard type of anti-glare filter consists of a coating that reduces the reflection from a glass or plastic surface. A biometric lock is any lock that can be activated by biometric features, such as a fingerprint, voiceprint, or retina scan. Biometric locks make it more difficult for someone to counterfeit the key used to open the lock or a user’s account. A smart card is a form of hardware token. A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card is a physical, electronic authorization device used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit chip. In high-security environments, employee badges may contain a smart card embedded chip that must be inserted into a smart card reader to log in or access information on the system. A badge reader is used to read an employee's identification badge using a magnetic stripe, barcode, or embedded RFID chip."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Hybrid drive"
    ],
    "explanation": "A hybrid hard drive (SSHD) is a storage drive that combines the large storage capacity of an HDD with the faster read/write speed of an SSD. The majority of the drive uses a spinning disk and actuator arm, like a traditional magnetic drive, but it also contains a small SSD (solid-state drive) as part of the combined hybrid drive unit. This allows data to be written to either the SSD portion (for data accessed more frequently like the OS and programs) while using the HDD portion to store larger amounts of rarely accessed files (such as photos and video files). Hybrid hard drives constantly monitor the data retrieved from storage, and it automatically determines which data you open the most. It places the files that you use most often on the SSD to read/write that data faster. A magnetic drive is a traditional hard disk drive (HDD). A hard disk drive (HDD) is a device providing persistent mass storage for a workstation or laptop by saving data even when the computer is turned off. Data is stored using platters with a magnetic coating that are spun under disk heads that can read and write to locations on each platter known as sectors. A solid-state drive (SSD) is a personal computer storage device that stores data in non-volatile special memory instead of on disks or tape. An optical drive is a storage device that uses a CD, DVD, or Blu-Ray disc to store and retrieve data."

The metering mechanism should be accessible to the customer via a reporting dashboard, providing complete transparency in usage and billing. Metered services are pre-paid, a-la-carte, pay-per-use, or committed offerings. A metered service like a database may charge its users based on the actual usage of the service resources on an hourly or monthly basis. For example, Dion Training used the AWS Lambda serverless product in some of our automation. This service charges us $0.20 for every 1 million requests processed. Resource pooling refers to the concept that allows a virtual environment to allocate memory and processing capacity for a VMs use. Rapid elasticity is used to describe scalable provisioning or the capability to provide scalable cloud computing services. Rapid elasticity is very critical to meet the fluctuating demands of cloud users. The downside of rapid elasticity implementations is that they can cause significant loading of the system due to the high resource number of allocation and deallocation requests. Using a synchronization app can allow the files to be stored on both the laptop and the cloud service while maintaining the latest versions in both places. This allows a user to synchronize content between all of their own devices, as well as share the cloud storage content with other users. Multiple users can simultaneously access the content to work collaboratively, or they can access it at different times. Each user's changes are typically marked with a flag or color highlighting to indicate who made changes to what content."

A mobile device can use its internal GPS, cellular, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi radios to identify its location. Wi-Fi positioning systems use the signal strength or angle of arrival of a signal to determine the device’s location within 1-4 meters. Bluetooth can be used within a building to provide an accurate of the device within 3-4 meters. The use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to determine the device’s location is known as an internal positioning system (IPS). Cellular radios can provide an approximate location based upon the triangulation of your position between different cellular towers. A GPS (global positioning system) device is used to determine a receiver's position on the Earth based on information received from 24 GPS satellites, which operate in a constellation in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The receiver must have a line-of-sight to four of the GPS satellites continuously to accurately determine its position on the earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude).

    "explanation": "The 5.0 GHz frequency has more individual channels giving it less congestion and interference than the 2.4 GHz frequency. The 5.0 GHz frequency supports higher data rates than the 2.4 GHz frequency due to lower levels of congestion and interference. The longer wavelength of 2.4 GHz makes it better at propagating through solid surfaces than the 5.0 GHz frequency. The 2.4 GHz frequency has a longer wavelength than the 5.0 GHz frequency. This longer wavelength gives the 2.4 GHz frequency the ability to cover a longer range using the same power output levels."

DisplayPort was created as a royalty-free standard to compete with HDMI. The digital video interface (DVI) was designed to replace the VGA port used by CRT monitors. The DVI interface supports digital-only or digital and analog signaling. The video graphics array (VGA) was developed as a 15-pin connector to provide analog video signaling to an external display. External SATA (eSATA) is a widely used interface for hard disks on modern desktop and laptop computers. eSATA uses a 7-pin L-shaped data connector with one device per port. eSATA operates at bandwidths of 1.5 Gbps, 3 Gbps, or 6 Gbps."

    "options": [
      "Unmanaged switch",
      "Repeater",
      "Access point",
      "Hub"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Unmanaged switch"
    ],
    "explanation": "A switch is a network device that receives incoming data into a buffer, then the destination MAC address is compared with an address table so that data is only sent out to the port with the corresponding MAC address. In a switched network, each port is in a separate collision domain. A managed switch is a switch with advanced networking functions and security settings that can be enabled and configured by an administrator. A hub provides no intelligence in its interconnection functions so that whatever is received on one port is repeated out every other port. This leads to many collisions occurring on the hub and increases the number of rebroadcasts which slows down the entire network. A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction. Repeaters may be wired or wireless, and they rebroadcast whatever signal is received through their transmitter. A wireless access point (WAP), or access point, connects directly to a wired local area network and the AP then provides wireless connections using Wi-Fi for other devices to use that wired connection. An AP supports the connection of multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection."

    "explanation": "In a RAID 5 storage array, you should replace the failed disk and then rebuild the array. If you remove the failed drive, the array can continue functioning at sub-optimal performance until a new drive is installed. The options to perform a system restore would result in downtime and possible data loss. Therefore they should not be selected. While you could run a RAID 5 with only 3 drives, this RAID 5 was already using 4 drives, and the loss of one of those drives by rebuilding it as a 3 drive RAID 5 would result in a 33% reduction in the amount of storage space."

There is no performance difference between different motherboard form factors, except for the size and number of expansion slots. Mini-ITX is the most commonly used form factor with HTPC systems because they require the smallest fans or passive cooling, which minimizes the noise produced by the system. A micro-ATX motherboard produces more heat and is larger than a mini-ITX motherboard. Micro-ATX motherboards also require a larger (and louder) fan to keep the system cooled, so it is a poor choice for an HTPC.

Now, bandwidth is more of a theoretical concept that measures how much data could be transferred from a source to a destination under ideal conditions. Throughput is an actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from the source to a destination. Therefore, we often measure throughput, instead of bandwidth, to monitor our network performance. Jitter is a network condition that occurs when a time delay in the sending of data packets over a network connection occurs.

A GPS (global positioning system) device is used to determine a receiver's position on the Earth based on information received from 24 GPS satellites, which operate in a constellation in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The receiver must have a line-of-sight to four of the GPS satellites continuously to accurately determine its position on the earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude). A cellular radio is a component in a mobile device capable of switching frequencies automatically when moving between network cells without losing the connection. Wi-Fi is the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networking based on spread spectrum radio transmission in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The standard has six main iterations (a, b, g, n, ac, and ax), describing different modulation techniques, supported distances, and data rates."

    "question": "Which of the following technologies is often used indoors by companies to locate a shopper's position in a store and provide them time-sensitive offers or discounts?",
    "options": [
      "Bluetooth",
      "GPS",
      "Cellular",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Bluetooth"
    ],
    "explanation": "A mobile device can use its internal GPS, cellular, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi radios to identify its location. When indoors, the devices can use either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to determine their location. Bluetooth can be used within a building to provide an accurate location of the device within 3-4 meters. Bluetooth location services are often used to identify where in a store a customer is located and present them with targeted offers. For example, if the store identified that you were in the frozen foods section, they might send you a push notification offering you a discount on a pint of ice cream. Wi-Fi positioning systems use the signal strength or angle of arrival of a signal to determine the device’s location within 1-4 meters. The use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to determine the device’s location is known as an internal positioning system (IPS). Cellular radios can provide an approximate location based upon the triangulation of your position between different cellular towers. A GPS (global positioning system) device is used to determine a receiver's position on the Earth based on information received from 24 GPS satellites, which operate in a constellation in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO). The receiver must have a line-of-sight to four of the GPS satellites continuously to accurately determine its position on the earth (latitude, longitude, and altitude). The device’s GPS receiver can provide an accurate location up to 10 meters."

It relies on the standard protocol known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP to respond to clients' broadcast queries. Since you have received an APIPA address (169.254.13.52), this signifies a DHCP failure. If a user is unable to access a website by using its domain name but can by its IP address, then this indicates a DNS resolution issue instead.

    "explanation": "An optical network terminal (ONT) is a device that connects fiber optics cables to other types of wiring such as Ethernet and phone lines by converting the signal from optical to electrical and vice versa. An ONT is commonly used with fiber to the house (FTTH) installations. A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG), and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access as cable internet, taking advantage of an HFC and RFoG network's high bandwidth. DSL is a technology used to transmit multimedia traffic at high-bit rates over twisted-pair copper wire (over ordinary telephone lines). This allows the telecommunications company to connect a user's home to the local switching center using normal telephone lines, then connect that local switching center (using a DSLAM to multiplex the connections) to the central office over a single high-speed cable (such as a fiber connection). Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management. Software-defined networking (SDN) uses Application Programming Interfaces (API) and compatible hardware that allows for the programming of network appliances and systems."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "The printer is running out of memory"
    ],
    "explanation": "The most likely reason for this failure is a lack of memory in the printer. A laser printer must load the entire image into memory before it can process it and print the image to the page. If the laser printer runs out of memory, it will print the part of the image it has processed in memory to the page and then fails. For example, if this printer only has 256 MB of RAM, then it will be able to print the vector graphics without any issues and will fail when trying to print full-size high-resolution photos that are 400 MB to 800 MB in size. There is no indication that there is fading in the printed images to indicate the toner is low. Whether using PCL or PostScript, the lack of memory will still cause the print job to fail. The print server is not timing out since the printer can load most of the image to its memory before failing."

      "Lightning"
    ],
    "explanation": "Lightning cables are used by Apple's iPhone, which are the only smartphones that run the iOS software. Since your friend is using iOS, he uses an iPhone (smartphone) or an older iPad (tablet). Lightning is a proprietary computer bus and power connector created by Apple. The lightning cable is used by every iPhone from the 5 to 13 series. Newer iPads have shifted to the use of USB-C for charging instead of the lightning cable, though. USB-C is the default standard used in USB 3.1 with a 24-pin connector. The connector is reversible and can be inserted in either direction. Micro USB is a miniaturized version of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface developed for connecting compact and mobile devices such as smartphones, Mp3 players, GPS devices, photo printers, and digital cameras. Micro USB connectors exist or have existed in three forms: micro A, micro B, and micro USB 3. Mini USB was introduced with USB 2.0 and was used with digital cameras and early tablets. Mini USB is not commonly used in modern devices."

    "explanation": "The mITX (Mini-ITX) form factor is 6.7\" x 6.7\" in size (17 cm x 17cm). The mITX is commonly used in smaller computer systems with a small form factor (SFF) case. These motherboards are usually used in computers designed for passive cooling and a low power consumption architecture, such as a home theater PC system. The mATX (microATX) motherboard's form factor is 9.6\" x 9.6\" in size (24 cm x 24 cm). The mATX form factor is commonly used in smaller computer systems with a small form factor (SFF) case. An mATX motherboard is backward-compatible with the larger ATX motherboard since it contains the same mounting point locations as the full-size board. An ATX motherboard's form factor is 12\" x 9.6\" in size (305mm x 244mm). ITX is a series of form factors that began with the mini-ITX, but there is no specific size called ITX."

    "correct_answer": [
      "The workstation couldn't reach the DHCP server"
    ],
    "explanation": "Since the customer's IP address is 169.254.34.12, it is an APIPA address. Since the workstation has an APIPA address, it means the DHCP server was unreachable. Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature of Windows-based operating systems that enables a computer to automatically assign itself an IP address when there is no Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server available to perform that function. APIPA serves as a DHCP server failover mechanism and makes it easier to configure and support small local area networks (LANs). If no DHCP server is currently available, either because the server is temporarily down or because none exists on the network, the computer selects an IP address from a range of addresses (from 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255) reserved for that purpose."

      "PoE switch",
      "Managed switch"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Managed switch"
    ],
    "explanation": "A switch is a network device that receives incoming data into a buffer, then the destination MAC address is compared with an address table so that data is only sent out to the port with the corresponding MAC address. In a switched network, each port is in a separate collision domain. A managed switch is a switch with advanced networking functions and security settings that can be enabled and configured by an administrator. An unmanaged switch operates out-of-the-box without any setup or configuration by switching network traffic based on MAC addresses and putting each switch port into its own collision domain. Power over Ethernet (POE) switches provide power over ordinary data cabling to devices such as VoIP handsets and wireless access points. PoE can support up to 15.4W and PoE+ can support up to 25W. A hub provides no intelligence in its interconnection functions so that whatever is received on one port is repeated out every other port. This leads to many collisions occurring on the hub and increases the number of rebroadcasts which slows down the entire network."

    "explanation": "The 802.11g (Wireless G) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 54 Mbps. The 802.11a (Wireless A) standard utilizes a 5 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 54 Mbps. The 802.11b (Wireless B) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 11 Mbps. The 802.11n (Wireless N) standard utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 108 Mbps or a 5.0 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at speeds up to 600 Mbps. Wireless N supports the use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology to use multiple antennas to transmit and receive data at higher speeds. Wireless N supports channel bonding by combining two 20 MHz channels into a single 40 MHz channel to provide additional bandwidth. The 802.11ac (Wireless AC or Wi-Fi 5) standard utilizes a 5 GHz frequency to provide wireless networking at theoretical speeds up to 3.5 Gbps. Wireless AC uses channel bonding to create a single channel of up to 160 MHz to provide additional bandwidth. Wireless AC uses multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technology to use multiple antennas to transmit and receive data at higher speeds. The 802.11ax (Wireless AX or Wi-Fi 6) standard utilizes 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies to provide wireless networking at theoretical speeds up to 9.6 Gbps. Wireless AC uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) to conduct multiplexing of the frequencies transmitted and received to each client to provide additional bandwidth. Wireless AC uses channel bonding to create a single channel of up to 160 MHz to provide additional bandwidth. Wireless AC uses multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technology to use multiple antennas to transmit and receive data at higher speeds.

      "QR code"
    ],
    "explanation": "In this case, you should select a QR code to meet this requirement. A QR code is a square that contains a specific graphical pattern that can be read by a smartphone's camera. When read, the graphical pattern is converted to data, such as a website address or link that can be easily opened. QR codes can also be read by dedicated QR scanners, as well. A barcode is a pattern of different sized parallel bars, typically representing a product number, such as an ISBN, EAN, or UPC. The reader uses a sensor mechanism (typically either a photodiode, laser, or CCD) to read the intensity of light reflected by the barcode. The reader then reports the number back to application software, which links it to a product database. Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. This is commonly used for contactless payment systems, transferring contacts, or transferring a file from one device to another. A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card is a physical, electronic authorization device used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit chip. In high-security environments, employee badges may contain a smart card embedded chip that must be inserted into a smart card reader to log in or access information on the system."

    "explanation": "The Domain Name System (DNS) servers provide resolution of host and domain names to their IP addresses and are essential for locating resources on the Internet. Most local networks also use DNS for name resolution. Typically, the DNS server would be the gateway address, though this may not be the case on all networks. Often two DNS server addresses (preferred and alternate) are specified for redundancy. DNS operates over TCP/UDP port 53, and if that is blocked, the client will be unable to convert the domain name (diontraining.com) to its IP address. The hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used to provide web content to browsers using port 80. The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is a secure protocol used to provide web content to browsers using SSL/TLS encryption over port 443. The dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used to allocate IP addresses to a host when it joins a network. DHCP utilizes UDP ports 67 and 68."

    "explanation": "An impact printer has teeth along the paper's edges that pull the paper along a tractor as it prints. This moves the paper up one line at a time. The print head moves from left to right across the page, impacting the print head through the ribbon to mark the paper. If the ribbon advance mechanism is defective, the ribbon will not advance as the print head goes across the page, leading to a lightening of the ink being marked on the paper. If the printer ribbon itself were worn out, it would be lighter in color as you went down the page (not from left to right)."

    "correct_answer": [
      "The smartphone reached the data cap for the month"
    ],
    "explanation": "A data cap or bandwidth cap is a service-provider imposed limitation on the amount of data transferred by a user’s account or device over the cellular network. Many smartphone plans that advertise unlimited data still have a transfer limit. Once the limit is reached, these plans will either prevent all data transfer from occurring or slow down the speeds of data transfer. For example, T-Mobile offers unlimited data in the United States, but if a user transfers over 50GB of data then their data is deprioritized and transmitted at slower speeds. Other carriers will use a data throttling method, instead, which slows down all data sent for the remainder of the customer’s billing cycle. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a denial of service attack that uses multiple compromised computers, called zombies, to launch the attack against a target. Based on the scenario, there is no evidence that the smartphone’s battery is depleted since the phone is still online and transmitting data. The smartphone is not using Wi-Fi to transmit the data and there is no evidence that the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) radio is broken."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Microwave"
    ],
    "explanation": "Long-range fixed wireless can be licensed or unlicensed depending on the frequencies and power levels being utilized. For example, an 802.11 wireless network could be established using a directional antenna to connect two buildings over several miles using unlicensed frequencies and minimal power levels (under 200 mW) which are under the FCC limits. Alternatively, a microwave link can be established in the 4.91 GHz to 5.97 GHz unlicensed frequency range using a point-to-multipoint microwave antenna and transceiver system. Conversely, a user could purchase a licensed cellular fixed wireless system that requires a license from the FCC to operate to ensure they are not interfering with other users and services in the same frequency band."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Battery is defective"
    ],
    "explanation": "Based on the description, the battery is defective and swelling. Swollen batteries, while not common, are a significant risk. They result from too much current inside a cell of the battery, which causes a build-up of heat and gas. This can be caused by overcharging, manufacturer defects, deep discharge, or damage to the battery. The most common cause is an overcharge of the battery, which causes a chemical reaction between the electrodes and the electrolyte, resulting in the release of heat and gases that expand inside the battery, causing the casing to swell or split open. If a battery begins to bulge, swell, or split, it should immediately be replaced."

Which of the following would be the NEXT step to perform in your troubleshooting efforts?",
    "options": [
      "Clean the printer's transfer roller",
      "Change the feed rate of the paper",

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Increase the temperature of the fuser element"
    ],
    "explanation": "When printing with a laser printer, the paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to 801°F (427°C) and pressure are used to bond the toner to the paper permanently. If you often print with specialty paper (i.e., envelopes, cardstock, & labels), you may want to turn up the fuser temperature on your printer. With thicker paper types, heat does not transfer as easily as it does with standard paper so the toner may not bond as well and the image could smear when it is touched."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Privacy screen"
    ],
    "explanation": "A privacy screen is a filter placed on a monitor to decrease the viewing angle of a monitor. This prevents the monitor from being viewed from the side and can help prevent shoulder surfing. The standard type of anti-glare filter consists of a coating that reduces the reflection from a glass or plastic surface. A biometric lock is any lock that can be activated by biometric features, such as a fingerprint, voiceprint, or retina scan. Biometric locks make it more difficult for someone to counterfeit the key used to open the lock or a user’s account. A smart card is a form of hardware token. A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card is a physical, electronic authorization device used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit chip. In high-security environments, employee badges may contain a smart card embedded chip that must be inserted into a smart card reader to log in or access information on the system. A badge reader is used to read an employee's identification badge using a magnetic stripe, barcode, or embedded RFID chip."

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Network tap"
    ],
    "explanation": "A network tap is used to create a physical connection to the network that sends a copy of every packet received to a monitoring device for capture and analysis. A WiFi analyzer can determine the wireless network's signal strength, the frequencies in use, and any possible radio frequency interference. A tone generator is connected to a wall jack and sends a repeating signal over the cable. The probe can then be used to detect which cable is attached to the wall jack by detecting the signal being sent by the tone generator. The probe needs to be near or touch the cable with the tone generator attached to identify it positively. A cable tester is used to ensure a cable is properly created as a patch cable (straight through) or a crossover cable. Cable testers provide detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of the cable. For example, they test and report cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, resistance, and other cable run characteristics."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Plenum"
    ],
    "explanation": "OBJ-3.1: Plenum-rated cable has a special insulation that has low smoke and low flame characteristics. Plenum cable is mandated to be installed in any air handling space. For example, most large office buildings use the space between the ceiling and the roof to return air to the AC unit. This qualifies this area as a plenum ceiling, and all the cables that go through that ceiling must be plenum rated. It is important to check your local building codes to see if you need to use plenum cable. These plenum cables cost more because the insulation material must meet the standards for plenum cables while also meeting the standards for their ethernet category such as 5e, 6a, or 7. Shielded cables contain a braided foil shield around the inner cabling to protect the data from the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI). Coaxial cables are a specialized type of copper cabling that uses a copper core to carry the electrical signal while being enclosed by plastic insulation and shielding to protect the data transmission from the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI). An optical fiber consists of an ultra-fine core of glass to carry the light signals surrounded by glass or plastic cladding that guides the light pulses along the core and a protective coating."

The higher the I/O bandwidth, the faster and more efficient a cloud file-storage synchronization application will become. Applications that rely on large amounts of reading and writing of data require a high amount of I/O bandwidth. Disk speed is not nearly as important since most cloud file-storage systems use a virtualized file system for storage and do not rely on a single disk.

    "explanation": "OBJ-1.2: An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display is a type of LED flat panel display device that uses organic compounds that emit light when subjected to an electric current. An OLED display works without a backlight because it emits visible light. Thus, it can display deep black levels and be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low ambient light conditions (such as a darker room), an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, regardless of whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or an LED backlight. An OLED will consume around 40% of an LCD's power, displaying a primarily black image. For most images, it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD. A liquid crystal display (LCD) panel is a type of display technology where the image is made up of liquid crystal cells controlled using electrical charges. The LCD panel is backlight by a cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) bulb. LCD panels are used on laptops and have replaced CRT monitors as the main type of computer display screen for desktops, as well. A light-emitting diode (LED) display is an LCD panel that uses a LED backlight instead of a CCFL backlight to provide its light source. A plasma display is a type of flat panel display that uses small cells containing plasma with ionized gas that responds to electric fields.

If the best setting is used, the printer will use more ink/toner in producing the image and printer more slowly. If the Fast, Draft, or Low settings are used, the printer will use less ink/toner and print more quickly. Page orientation is the way in which a rectangular page is oriented for normal viewing. The two most common types of orientation are portrait and landscape. Duplex printing is a feature of some computer printers, multi-function printers (MFPs), and copy machines that allow the printing of a sheet of paper on both sides automatically. Without this capability, print devices can only print on a single side of the paper, sometimes called single-sided printing or simplex printing. With duplex printing, information is printed on the front side of a piece of paper, and then the paper is automatically fed back through the printer to print the information on the backside of the paper. The tray setting is used to define what type of paper is being used by a printer. The tray setting is commonly set to auto, letter in the United States, or A4 in Europe."

IPS displays have great color accuracy, but they do not support higher refresh rates sought after by gamers. A twisted nematic (TN) LCD panel uses technology where the panel is black when no electric current is running through the liquid crystal cells because the cells align themselves in a twisted state. When an electric current is applied, the liquid crystal cells untwist, allowing light to pass through, resulting in a white display screen. TN displays can be made with high refresh rates of 120 Hz or 144 Hz which makes them popular with gamers. A vertical alignment (VA) LCD panel uses technology designed to have liquid crystals lay perpendicular to the glass substrate when power is removed and in a vertical position when voltage is applied. This allows light to move through the liquid pixels when voltage is applied and the image is then produced. VA displays are a good middle-ground between IPS and TN panel displays.

When only the LCD is broken, you can still use the touchscreen, but the panel will have dark blobs or spider web cracks (or both). When both LCD and touchscreen are damaged, you may still be able to use portions of the touchscreen, and some parts of the LCD may display the image, but you will incur obvious difficulties in using the device as normal. A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a microprocessor used on dedicated video adapter cards or within a CPU with integrated graphics capability to handle the mathematical calculations required to create immersive and 3D graphics. The inverter (also known as inverter board, screen inverter, or LCD inverter) is a part of the laptop's display assembly. The inverter is a small green board attached to the base of the LCD panel. In a laptop computer, the LCD screen relies on a backlight source to uniformly light up the screen, and the inverter acts as the power supply for this lighting source. If the inverter is faulty, the display will be too dim to easily see without an external light source like a flashlight."

    "explanation": "OBJ-2.7: A personal area network (PAN) is a close-range network that is usually based on Bluetooth or NFC for communications between personal devices, such as smartphones, laptops, printers, and other peripheral devices. A local area network (LAN) is a network where all the nodes or hosts participating in the network are directly connected with cables or short-range wireless media. A wide area network (WAN) is a network that spans multiple geographic locations such as the internet. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits. A storage area network (SAN) is a dedicated, independent high-speed network that interconnects and delivers shared pools of storage devices to multiple servers. A storage area network often uses Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Fibre Channel, or Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) connections to achieve the speeds necessary to support SAN operations."

    "explanation": "OBJ-1.4: 4G cellular technology is made up of LTE and LTA-A. Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a packet data communications specification providing an upgrade path for both GSM and CDMA2000 cellular networks. LTE has a theoretical speed of 150 Mbps and a real-world speed of around 20 Mbps. LTE Advanced (LTE-A) has a theoretical speed of 300 Mbps and a real-world speed of around 40 Mbps. 5G cellular technology is made up of three different types: low-band, mid-band, and high-band mmWave technology. Low-band 5G reaches an average speed of 55 Mbps with a theoretical speed of 150 Mbps. Mid-band 5G reaches an average speed of 150 Mbps with a theoretical speed of 1.5 Gbps. High-band 5G reaches an average speed of 3 Gbps with a theoretical speed of up to 70 Gbps. 3G cellular technology is made up of two different technologies: HSPA+ and EV-DO. HSPA+ (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access) is a 3G standard used for GSM cellular networks and can support up to a theoretical download speed of 168 Mbps and a theoretical upload speed of 34 Mbps. In the real world, though, HSPA+ normally reaches speeds around 20 Mbps. EV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized) is a 3G standard used for CDMA cellular networks and can support up to 3.1 Mbps downloads. A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a wireless network topology where all nodes, including client stations, can provide forwarding and path discovery to improve coverage and throughput compared to using just fixed access points and extenders."

    "explanation": "OBJ-2.1: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless, non-guaranteed method of data communication. It does not provide any sequencing or flow control. Data sent over UDP could be lost and never resent. For this reason, UDP is not used for general web browsing or activity over HTTP/HTTPS (Ports 80 and 443). UDP is very good at delivering streaming media, though, since UDP is faster than TCP. Streaming videos or making Voice over IP (VoIP) calls are examples of use cases that rely upon UDP for their transmission."

    "correct_answer": [
      "The RAID array is rebuilding itself"
    ],
    "explanation": "OBJ-5.3: The RAID 5 array is rebuilding itself and causing slower performance. A RAID 5 provides block-level striping with distributed parity to provide redundancy using a minimum of three disks. When a disk fails in the RAID 5 array, the drive can continue to operate without data loss using the remaining two hard drives. When a failed drive is replaced, the RAID array must be rebuilt by calculating the missing data that was previously stored on the failed drive and copying it to the new drive. This process will slow down the overall performance of the RAID until the array is fully rebuilt and performance returns to normal. The technician cannot replace an HDD with an SSD without replacing the entire RAID. RAID arrays should use the same size and model of hard drives for best performance. The technician could not have replaced the wrong drive otherwise the entire RAID would fail since only a portion of the data on the RAID would remain (one of three drives). The technician did not change any settings in the question so it is unlikely that I/O caching was changed or disabled."

    "correct_answer": [
      "There are never compatibility issues."
    ],
    "explanation": "There are many benefits to using a touch pen (stylus) with your touchscreen computer. For artists especially, they can be more precise in their work than is possible with fingers. They're more sanitary than fingers and don't leave behind the oils that your skin would on the screen. They're easier to create handwritten notes than using your finger is. The only downside is that they are not all compatible with every touch screen, so you need to know what kind of touchscreen you have to ensure that your touch pen is compatible with it. Most touchscreens are capacitive, which means the touch pen needs to be constructed so that it will interrupt an electrostatic field. Resistive screens only register pressure. Their advantage is that almost any material can be used to make a touch pen and resistive screens are better for uses such as making lines darker in a drawing program. There are also Bluetooth touch pens, which use a wireless signal to communicate contact with the screen."

It is usually placed between the outside world and the LAN, so it can function as a gateway as well as a security appliance. A proxy server can be a very powerful force for good on your network. Proxy servers can be a firewall blocking traffic based on port number. They can also inspect packets for objectionable or malicious content (malware). They can even work as a cache for frequently visited websites, and since all traffic goes through the proxy server, into and out of your network, they are the default gateway.

    "explanation": "If the device does not produce sound, first make sure that it's not set to silent operation. Most mobile devices will have a switch on the side that sets them to silent or vibrate mode, which will mute the device and keep it from making noises. Also check settings for volume as well as possible redirection of sound, such as an active Bluetooth pairing. If the speakers have failed on a mobile device, it's time for a new device."

    "correct_answer": [
      "There is a scratch in the EP drum.",
      "The charging corona wire is dirty."
    ],
    "explanation": "A groove or scratch in the EP drum can cause the problem of vertical black lines running down all or part of the page. Because a scratch is lower than the surface, it doesn't receive as much (if any) of a charge as the other areas. The result is that toner sticks to it as though it were discharged. The groove may go around the circumference of the drum, so the line may go all the way down the page. Another possible cause of vertical black lines is a dirty charging corona wire. A dirty charging corona wire prevents a sufficient charge from being placed on the EP drum. Because the charge on the EP drum is almost zero, toner sticks to the areas that correspond to the dirty areas on the charging corona."

      "40 MHz."
    ],
    "explanation": "802.11ac is in the 5 GHz band, and can be 20, 40, or 80 MHz wide. With the 80 MHz channel width, there are effectively two channels, channel 36-48 and channel 149-161. Since you have three access points, you should use the 40 MHz channel width, which provides four possible channels: 36-40, 44-48, 149-153, and 157-161. The 20 MHz channel width provides nine channels, but you don't need that many, and the narrower channel width would decrease the performance per client.

Managed switches contain software that allows for port configuration, diagnostics, and monitoring situations such as port flapping. An unmanaged switch is simply a connectivity device. It can't be used to segregate ports into separate VLANs. A bridge is used to aggregate two or more networks into one. A hub is simply a connectivity device that is a single collision domain, whereas each port on a switch (managed or not) is its own collision domain. Hubs are seldom found on networks now, but they are often used to provide multiple ports for a single connection on a computer such as a USB port.

      "5,400 rpm drive",

      "m.SATA",
      "M.2"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "M.2"
    ],
    "explanation": "Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe ) is a driver and communication interface for Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe)-based solid-state drives (SSDs). It uses the PCIe bus but can be PCIe, M.2, and U.2 form factors. It transfers data much faster than the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) that was used for SATA. Both AHCI and NVMe SSDs can use the PCIe slot and M.2 connectors on motherboards, so it's important to know whether the M.2 connector supports AHCI, NVMe, or both. U.2 is only NVMe, but it isn't on the CompTIA A+ objectives. SATA will use the AHCI interface, even if it's connected to an M.2 slot on the motherboard. mSATA is a different form factor and can't be used in an M.2 slot."

    "explanation": "Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks (RAID) level 0 is disk striping and provides improved performance, but no fault tolerance. RAID 1, mirroring, provides fault tolerance but no improvement in performance. Both RAID 0 and RAID 1 require two drives. RAID 5 provides both fault tolerance and enhanced performance, and requires a minimum of three drives.

    "explanation": "Mini PCIe cards running in PCIe 1.0 x1 mode have a maximum speed of 2.5 Gbps, per lane. Each send and receive pair in PCIe is a lane, and PCIe can have 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 lanes. PCIe that uses one lane is noted as PCIe x1, two lanes are x2, and so on. Successive versions of PCIe have increased the speed per lane. PCIe 2.0 speed per lane is 5 Gbps, 3.x is 8 Gbps, and 4.x is 16 Gbps per lane.

It provides fault tolerance, but it doesn't protect your system against human error, so you still need backups! RAID 0 is disk striping, which enhances performance but doesn't help at all with fault tolerance. RAID 5 is disk striping with parity, so it offers fault tolerance and performance improvement. Data is written on two drives and the third is striped with recovery data. The recovery data is put on each drive in turn. If one drive fails, there is enough recovery data on the other two to rebuild it.

    ],
    "explanation": "OLED displays have many advantages over LCDs. IPS and VA are both types of LCDs, and some displays use LED backlighting. OLEDs don't need backlighting because the carbon-based material they are created from provides the light and color. Fewer layers are needed so OLED displays can be made thinner than LED displays. The color contrast is better than LED displays, and they have faster refresh rates and the unique characteristic of being foldable."

    "explanation": "Mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) systems can be used to ensure the security of your company information on employee's personal devices. They can be used to block downloading or printing of certain information and can be used to lock or wipe lost or stolen devices or remove company data from mobile devices when an employee has left the company. A preferred roaming list (PRL) will be updated as needed on a mobile device to ensure that you can roam and connect to the proper cell towers. GSM is the Global System for Mobile Communications and defines how 2G cellular networks work. GSM is used in Europe and much of the world. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is mainly used in the United States and was used on 2G and 3G phone systems. 5G is the current standard in many places."

      "Username",
      "Soft token"

    "correct_answer": [

    "explanation": "Your username is identification—telling a system who you are. Authentication means proving to a system that you are who you say you are, and that is done by something you know, something you have, something you are, or somewhere you are. In a two-factor authentication system, you first identify yourself to the system (username), and provide your first authentication, usually a password (something you know), then you need another form of authentication. A key fob is a small device, about the size of a key chain, that uses algorithms to generate a numeric key that lasts for only a few seconds and is unique to the application and the user. An authenticator app is software on a device that does the same thing, and it is a type of soft token. A key fob is considered a hard token."

    "explanation": "Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are used for downloading email messages from a server. The difference between the two is that IMAP allows the messages to remain on the server so they can be accessed from different devices, where with POP3, the email messages will only exist on the device they were downloaded on. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for sending an email. A good way to remember which is for sending and receiving is to remember that S (as in SMTP) is for sending.

    "question": "An employee travels between multiple offices, using a desktop system in each office. What technology would ensure that the employee's desktop icons, files, and applications stay uniform across systems in all the offices?",
    "options": [
      "On-Demand Desktop Streaming",
      "VDI in the cloud",
      "Desktop emulation",
      "Synchronized folders"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "VDI in the cloud"
    ],
    "explanation": "A Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) moves the desktop icons, files, and folders to a server instead of the desktop originating from the local machine. When the desktop experience is hosted on a centralized server location, the icons, files, and folders are the same. With this user working from different offices, the best solution for them is VDI in the cloud. On-Demand Desktop Streaming is a Dell streaming service where the desktops and files are stored on a server that provides them to thin clients without drives over gigabit Ethernet. Desktop emulation is software that imitates a desktop. Synchronized folders means that your documents will be the same whether you log into a desktop, laptop, or other mobile device. Changes on one are synchronized to the other devices."

      "The Wi-Fi card is not seated properly."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "The antenna is not connected."
    ],
    "explanation": "When replacing a Wi-Fi card, it is important to remember to connect the antenna. The connection is usually a wire with a terminating end that snaps onto the card. A Wi-Fi card is seated into a laptop and is usually a peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) type connector. Having the card incorrectly seated would render the Wi-Fi card unrecognizable and not function at all. Devices within a computer require software drivers to function. Since the system identified the card properly, then the support technician installed the correct drivers. There are varying specifications for Wi-Fi. Since the Wi-Fi is receiving a signal, the Wi-Fi card is compatible with the company's Wi-Fi system."

    "explanation": "A smartphone or tablet can be configured as a personal hotspot to share its cellular data connection with other computer devices. This approach can be used to simulate being on an external network. To connect a peripheral device via Bluetooth, the Bluetooth radio on each device must be put into discoverable mode, which is also known as pairing mode. When using Bluetooth, the pairing system should automatically generate a passkey or PIN code when a connection request is received by a peripheral device.

    "correct_answer": [
      "Replacement"
    ],
    "explanation": "A replacement drive approach only has the data backed up from the old drive. The technician then fits the new drive to the laptop and reinstalls all software. Then, the technician can restore user data from the backup. An upgrade is a general term, and with software, an upgrade occurs between software versions. With hardware, newer hardware replaces older hardware. While a hardware upgrade occurs in the scenario, it does not define the technician's steps. Migration means using backup software to create an image of the old drive and storing it on a USB or other type of media. Cloning a disk is similar to migration in that it makes a copy of an entire drive to another storage device."

Corruption of the boot section can cause the error message, 'Boot device not found.' An external bootable device can access the drive through the OS to attempt to fix the data or simply recover the data. Disk thrashing is a constant read/write activity on the drive. Low random access memory (RAM), faulty software, or malware can cause disk thrashing to occur. A grinding noise indicates mechanical problems with a hard disk drive (HDD).

Check if the projector's fan is working and that the vents are free from dust and not obstructed. A burned-out bulb will not turn the projector off but will instead cease to display an image. A bad high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) cable can cause problems, but the fact that the projector was working for over two hours and then shut down does not point to a cable problem. Connectors that are not securely plugged in can generally be diagnosed by a flashing screen, not turning off."

The image will appear fuzzy if the output resolution does not match the display device's native resolution. This fuzzy resolution typically happens if the video card's driver is faulty or incorrectly configured. The user should check the brightness and contrast controls if the image is very dim, not if it is flickering. If a computer produces digital art, it is very important that the user calibrate the display to scanning devices and print output. Color calibration (or workflow) refers to a process of adjusting the screen and scanner settings to balance color input and output."

    "explanation": "Suppose the system boots, but a second fixed disk or removable drive does not appear in File Explorer. The technician should first check that the system has initialized and formatted with a partition structure and file system. If the system does not detect the disk by a configuration tool, such as Windows Disk Management, the technician will suspect that there is a hardware or cable/connector fault. The computer booted up correctly, so a corrupted boot sector is not the problem. Overheating is generally detected by the computer becoming hot to the touch. Bad sectors occur when parts of a hard disk drive (HDD) fail, resulting in read/write failures and not the inability to see a hard drive in the OS."

    "explanation": "The computer is overheating. Even with all the fans working properly, computers cannot have personal space heaters blowing directly on them. Redirecting the heater should resolve the problem. Intermittent shutdowns can be an indicator of malware, but the physical details in this example do not point to malware as the problem. A power supply unit (PSU) that is not delivering stable power can cause intermittent shutdowns, but this does not seem to be the problem here. Instead, the space heater is the apparent problem. Hard drive failure can result in intermittent shutdowns and is diagnosed with OS tools, such as the chkdsk command. However, this is unlikely to be the problem in this case."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Failed display backlight"
    ],
    "explanation": "If a display's image is so dim that it is almost invisible, the backlight has probably failed. The technician will need to replace the backlight or get it repaired under warranty. The image will appear fuzzy if the output resolution does not match the display device's native resolution. This fuzzy resolution typically happens if the video card's driver is faulty or incorrectly configured. Dead pixels occur when individual pixels stay black. A technician generally cannot fix dead pixels. Incorrect cables can cause many problems, from flickering screens to audio problems. However, in this case, it is unlikely to be the problem."

    "explanation": "After the troubleshooting steps listed, the next reasonable step would be to replace the power cord with a known good cord. If there is a problem with the cord, and the computer boots with a known good cord, then that was the issue. After checking the power cord, disconnect any extra devices. For example, the power supply unit (PSU) might be under-powered for the external device. For diagnosing blank screen problems, plug in a known good external monitor. However, it is not appropriate when the computer is not getting power. Checking system configurations can help diagnose application crashes or intermittent restarts, but it is not possible if the computer is not getting power."

    "explanation": "No LED status indicator lights could indicate that the whole system might not be receiving power or that the individual disk could be faulty. A read/write error can indicate faulty sectors in a hard disk drive (HDD). Likewise, a power failure or a mechanical fault can damage a sector. If the technician runs a test utility, such as the chkdsk command, and chkdsk locates more bad sectors each time the technician runs the test, it is a sign that the disk is about to fail. During the power-on self-test (POST), three long beeps will indicate a keyboard issue. The error message, 'Boot device not found,' would indicate a corrupted boot sector."

    "explanation": "For faded or faint prints, if a simple cause, such as the user choosing an option for low density (draft output), can be discounted, then this is most likely to indicate that the toner cartridge needs replacing. If the paper is not feeding into the printer, check that the paper is not creased, damp, or dirty. If the printer is feeding multiple sheets also check the paper size and weight. For incorrect page orientation, the paper size and orientation must be set correctly for the print job or the finishing/binding will be aligned to the wrong edge."

However, the drive has not yet failed, so the first thing to do is perform data backups. Immediately replacing the drive will result in full data loss. However, the drive has not failed yet, so the technician should back up the data before replacing the drive.

    "explanation": "Whenever a device does not function as expected, the technician should always consider malware. Malware or rogue apps are likely to try to collect data in the background. As a result, the device can become unresponsive and force system crashes. A faulty battery is unlikely to cause apps to crash. An overheating battery can force a phone to turn off, but there is no mention of overheating. Video configuration problems can result in blurry images but would not cause apps to crash.

      "Not enough system RAM"
    ],
    "explanation": "Constantly on light-emitting diode (LED) indicator lights imply disk thrashing. Disk thrashing occurs when there is not enough system random access memory (RAM), so the system continually uses the disk for paging (virtual memory). It could also signify a faulty software process or that malware has infected the system. A faulty boot sector would display the error message, \"Bootable device not found\" instead of constantly on LED indicator lights. If the device does not boot at all, a physical connection in the computer could be faulty. Loud clicking or grinding noises as the drive is operating indicate mechanical problems with the drive. Therefore, the technician should replace the hard disk drive (HDD) as soon as possible."

      "Grinding noises"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Burning smell"
    ],
    "explanation": "Excessive heat can easily damage a computer. A burning smell will almost always indicate that something (probably the power supply) is overheating. Shut down the system immediately and investigate the problem. Grinding or clicking noises generally indicate a mechanical problem with the hard drive disk (HDD), not overheating problems. LED status lights can indicate if the computer is getting power or other diagnostic codes. They do not indicate overheating. A blank screen can indicate anything from no power to a faulty screen. A blank screen does not directly point to overheating problems."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Change the display source."
    ],
    "explanation": "The computer and the monitor display are on, and a cable connects the two. The next thing to check is to ensure the user chooses the appropriate data source. Generally, a menu on the display will change the data source to the appropriate high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) cable. The monitor display is already on, indicated by the \"no input\" on the screen. The HDMI cable may be the problem, but the more obvious problem is that the user chose the wrong input source on the display screen. A burned-out bulb is a problem with a light-emitting diode (LED) projector, not a large monitor display."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Under-powered adapter"
    ],
    "explanation": "AC adapters can get mixed up. If an under-powered adapter is used, the laptop will display a warning at boot. Using the wrong adapter can cause problems, such as the battery not completely charging. As batteries age, they no longer hold a charge and need to be replaced. This would be the best answer, except that the boot error points to another problem. A swollen battery indicates a problem with the battery's charging circuit. This can be diagnosed by the keyboard or trackpad being pushed up or the laptop wobbling when sitting on a flat surface. Charging ports can be damaged by improper insertion and removal of the connectors. Signs of this are no charging or intermittent charging."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Check if the monitor connects to the computer."
    ],
    "explanation": "A systematic approach to troubleshooting helps save time and effort. After verifying that the monitor is getting power, checking that the monitor connects to the computer is the next logical step. The power supply unit (PSU) is a component on the computer that can cause intermittent issues if it is failing. There is no indication that the PSU is the problem here. Incorrect monitor input settings can cause a blank screen but the technician should follow the step verifying that the monitor connects to the computer first. Physical damage to a computer can cause problems, but there is no indication that this could be the problem and is not a logical next step."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Display burn-in"
    ],
    "explanation": "When the same static image displays for an extended period, it can damage the monitor's picture elements, causing a ghost image to \"burn\" permanently onto the display. An animated screensaver can help prevent this problem. If the output resolution does not match the display device's native resolution, then the image will appear fuzzy. Incorrect settings or a failed backlight can cause a dim image. Adjusting the brightness and contrast of a display can help fix a dim image. A flat-panel monitor defect may cause individual pixels to be \"stuck\" or \"dead.\" If a digital display panel has stuck pixels and the panel is not replaceable under warranty, then software utilities are available to reactivate pixels."

    "correct_answer": [
      "Faulty video card"
    ],
    "explanation": "A faulty or overheating video card could cause a flickering screen. Attaching the display device to a different computer isolates the cause of the issue. Since the flickering stopped when connected to a different computer, the display is not the problem. If the display were failing, it would also likely include bright or dim bands or lines and bright spots at the edge of the screen. An incorrect resolution will cause a blurry image but not a flickering image. Incorrect contrast controls can cause a dim image but not a flickering image."

      "Controller failure",
      "Disk failure"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Controller failure"
    ],
    "explanation": "If the redundant array of independent disks (RAID) array cannot boot, the first step is to use the configuration utility to verify the status. If the system cannot reach it, then the controller likely failed. Single disk failure would not stop the booting process from happening. RAID arrays operate so that a single disk can fail and not cause any data loss. Misconfiguration can always be a problem, but no recent changes occurred in this case. If it was booting fine before and no configurations have changed, then misconfiguration is highly unlikely to be the problem. A failed real-time clock (RTC) battery will cause an incorrect date or time but will not stop a RAID array from booting."

      "System memory problem"
    ],
    "explanation": "Not all modern computers use power-on self-test (POST) beep codes, but it is a valuable diagnostic tool. For example, the continuous beep code indicates a problem with system memory modules or memory controllers. This problem can stop the computer from booting or from displaying properly. The system will indicate a keyboard issue with three long beeps, and the technician can generally solve it by removing whatever is depressing a key. A faulty screen would result in a blank screen, but it does not give the POST beep code. A power supply error results in either repeating short beeps or the computer failing to initiate POST at all."

      "Overheating"
    ],
    "explanation": "A computer's cooling system relies on airflow through heatsinks and fans to remove heat from critical components. When dust accumulates in these passages, it acts as an insulator, restricting airflow and preventing proper heat dissipation. This leads to components running at higher-than-normal temperatures, a condition known as overheating."

    ],
    "explanation": "When a display works but touch input does not, the problem is isolated to the touch component (the digitizer). The most common causes are:\nHardware Mismatch: The technician may have accidentally installed a standard non-touch screen instead of the required touch-screen model.\nPhysical Connection Issue: The digitizer has its own separate, small ribbon cable that connects to the motherboard. If this cable is loose, disconnected, or damaged, the touch functionality will not work.\nSoftware/Driver Issue: The new hardware may require specific drivers to be installed for the operating system to recognize and use its touch capabilities."

Which of the following motherboard/processor combinations should the technician order to get the best performance while minimising licensing fees?",
    "options": [
      "A single-processor motherboard with ten overclocked cores.",

      "IPS"
    ],
    "explanation": "There are three types of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technologies listed in the A+ exam objectives: Twisted Nematic (TN), In-Plane Switching (IPS), and Vertical Alignment (VA). IPS LCDs provide better color representation as well as wider viewing angles, so that would be the best choice for this situation. Their drawbacks are somewhat slower response times and they tend to be a bit more expensive. Considering the other two types of LCD technologies, TN displays were developed first. They use less power compared to IPS and VA; however, when you start viewing them at wider angles, the picture quality suffers greatly. VA LCDs have slower response times than either IPS or TN, but they have the best contrast and image depth. SVA, or Super Vertical Alignment, is a Samsung term, not a standard, but it claims to offer better viewing angles than VA displays. LED monitors use Light Emitting Diodes as the backlight for an LCD. There are also microLED monitors and OLED monitors that create colors using LEDs with no backlight required."

The drawback is that they may not be as bright as an LED (Light Emitting Diode) display. LED and mini-LED displays use LEDs for backlighting, but still need the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) panel. QLED is a marketing name, but QLED displays use a quantum dot layer providing more color depth than regular LED displays. Micro-LEDs use three microscopic LEDs (red, green, and blue) to make each pixel, and each pixel can be turned on or off like an OLED TV.

    "explanation": "To physically secure your laptop, use a cable lock. Essentially, a cable lock anchors your device to a physical structure, making it nearly impossible for someone to walk off with it. LoJack is software that can help secure data but does not prevent physical theft. A protective cover will help protect your device from damage if it gets dropped (and some are waterproof too), but it won't stop someone from stealing it. Docking stations are usually used in your home office or corporate office to provide a mobile device, such as a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, with access to external devices that can provide charging, speakers, and other features."

Which accessory can they purchase to avoid plugging each of these devices separately into their laptop every time they return to the desk? (Choose two.)",
    "options": [

    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Port replicator",
      "Docking station"
    ],
    "explanation": "A docking station often replicates the functions of the ports on the back of a laptop so that peripherals such as displays, keyboards, printers, and so on that don't travel with the laptop can remain connected to the dock and don't all have to be unplugged physically each time the laptop is taken away. Docking stations effectively turn a laptop computer into a desktop computer, and the docking station may offer its own devices, such as an optical drive and speakers. It may have a generic connector such as USB-C or a proprietary connector. Docking station can also mean a charging cradle for a smartphone or tablet to plug in vertically that provides other functions such as built-in speakers for music playback or a clock. Two examples are Android Radio and Music Dock or Apple's Universal Dock. This differs from a port replicator, whose main function is to let the user connect several devices at once and doesn't require the laptop to offer connectivity between the devices. A KVM switch enables you to use one keyboard, video device, and mouse (hence the name, KVM) with two or more system units. Desktop station is not an actual term."

    ],
    "explanation": "A port replicator is an attachment that provides the same ports as or additional ports to a laptop. The devices can communicate with each other via the port replicator whether or not the laptop is there. Docking stations are similar to port replicators because they provide a single connection to a laptop that will connect several devices, but the point of the docking station is to effectively make a laptop function as a desktop PC. Whereas a docking station may (or may not) be a proprietary device, a port replicator is not, and will generally provide a connection to the external devices via a USB or similar port. Docking station can also mean a charging cradle for a smartphone or tablet. KVM switches allow multiple system units to share a keyboard, video and mouse. Docking port is not an actual term."

    ],
    "explanation": "The overwhelming majority of Wi-Fi antenna connectors for indoor-rated antennas found on laptops are type SMA (SubMiniature version A). On the device will be an SMA-female. What makes a connector \"male\" is the center pin and threads on the inside, while a \"female\" connector will have a receptor for the pin and threads on the outside. RP (reverse polarity) means that the pin and receptor are in opposite positions with regard to connector gender while the outside housing remains the same. SMA-RP and SMA are therefore not compatible with each other. N-type connectors look similar but are weatherproof and larger than SMA connectors."

Authentication can be based on something you know (like a password), something you have (a security card or cell phone, for example), something you are (biometrics: fingerprint readers, face scanners), or somewhere that you are. Sending an access code to a cell phone via text message after you've entered your username and password is one type of two-factor authentication. Authenticator applications on your laptop or phone generate codes that last usually only for seconds.

    "question": "Your client is frustrated that their Bluetooth earpiece that was working yesterday is no longer working, and they've asked for your help. What is the likely source of the problem?",
    "options": [
      "The earpiece has paired to a different device.",
      "The earpiece is broken.",
      "The Wi-Fi signal is weak.",
      "Bluetooth connectivity was lost."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "Bluetooth connectivity was lost."

    "question": "The Wi-Fi connection between your laptop and network has failed. Upon examining Device Manager you notice that the network card is not listed. You've reseated the card and it still isn't found in Device Manager, so you've decided to replace it. Which of the following card types will you likely need to purchase?",
    "options": [
      "PCIe",
      "PCI",
      "M.2",
      "PCMCIA"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "M.2"
    ],
    "explanation": "Most likely you'll need to purchase an M.2 Wi-Fi card, and it's the only option listed that would work. Before you purchase a replacement, verify that your laptop has an internal connector and note what type it is. Then disable the onboard Wi-Fi, if there is one, before installing the new card. Mini-PCIe is a laptop connector standard that was largely replaced by M.2 connectors. PCIe and PCI are for desktop computers; PCI having been replaced by the newer, faster PCIe. PCMCIA is a legacy type of laptop connector. If there is no internal connector for a Wi-Fi card, you could purchase a USB Wi-Fi card, but it will take up one of your ports and may get bumped, and it was not listed as an option for this question."

    "question": "A technician needs to replace a hard drive that failed in their new laptop. What type of drive will they likely need? (Choose two.)",
    "options": [
      "M.2",
      "mSATA",

      "3.52"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [
      "M.2",
      "mSATA"
    ],
    "explanation": "Modern laptops most likely use either mSATA or M.2 drives, which are thinner than a RAM module and much smaller. Legacy laptops used 1.8\" or 2.5\" drives, and desktop computers have historically used 3.5² hard drives."
